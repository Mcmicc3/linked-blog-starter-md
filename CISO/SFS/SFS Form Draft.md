Info Sys and Tech- Cyber Security Conc--BS

The reason I have decided to apply for this scholarship, is so that I may take this opportunity to further develop my cybersecurity education to become a better skilled cybersecurity practitioner, and use the skills I've developed to better serve the United States. I'm committed to applying my knowledge to meaningful work that will make a positive impact to the American People. Throughout my time studying at CSUSB, I've demonstrated my commitment to academic engagement through my involvement with the CISO club, and I would be eager to continue contributing to the club to make a positive impact to the CISO community.


In the time that I would be contracted to stay two years for my masters, I intend to serve and give back to CSUSB by actively developing my skills ontop of school assignments, by studying and working on projects, and then giving back to the club through leading projects and being a cyber mentor for the future generation of cyber students.
