Info Sys and Tech- Cyber Security Conc--BS

The reason I have decided to apply for this scholarship, is so that I may take this opportunity to further develop my cybersecurity education to become a better skilled cybersecurity practitioner, and use the skills I've developed to better serve the United States. I'm committed to applying my knowledge to meaningful work that will make a positive impact to the American People. In the time I've studied for my Bachelors, I've shown that I like to get involved in my academic studies through my involvement with the CISO club, and I would like to continue my involvement to make a positive impact on the CISO community by leading projects and participating in CMP. 


In the time that I would be contracted to stay two years for my masters, I intend to serve and give back to CSUSB by actively developing my skills ontop of school assignments, by studying and working on projects, and then giving back to the club through leading projects and being a cyber mentor for the future generation of cyber students.
