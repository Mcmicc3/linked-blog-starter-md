## As of Now
I don't know how much I should heavily rely on HTB
I don't know if I'm committed to making new slides from scratch each week..
	*Hence HTB*
My problem with HTB, is that my main goal is to come up with a tangible project at the end.

## ChatGPT prompts:
1. I want to lead a project that teaches cybersecurity students Active Directory. Can you explain to me the ideal target audience that my project would be for, and the possible careers opportunities they could get if they choose to become experts in the field? I want to reach a wide target audience, from folks interesting to blue, red, and purple teaming. 
2. Design a structured 14-week lesson plan for cybersecurity students focused on Active Directory. The curriculum should balance lecture-based instruction with hands-on labs, covering fundamental Active Directory concepts before progressing to cybersecurity applications relevant to both blue team and red team roles. Provide a logical week-by-week breakdown with a gradual progression in difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced), based on industry best practices. Dedicate one week to exploring AI integration with the Cloud in the context of Active Directory and cybersecurity. Prioritize real-world skill development, ensuring students complete a project that is resume-worthy. The lesson plan should be practical, engaging, and industry-aligned, equipping students with tangible experience they can showcase to employers.
3. What are alternatives to Active Directory for enterprises that choose not to use it? Why would they want to choose something else?
