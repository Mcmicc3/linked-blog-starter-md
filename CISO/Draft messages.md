# Draft email to Dr. Coulson

Good {} Dr. Coulson

My name is Mario Canales, I am a Senior here at CSUSB, and I recently submitted my interest form for the SFS program. I'm still waiting for my letters of recommendations to submit for SFS and for the Master's program, but I wanted to email to let you know that I'm still interested in this program, and would like to request time to speak to you about some questions and concerns I have about the program. I will commit to having everything submitted before the deadline, but can we schedule a meeting ahead of time so I may ask my questions

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if you have any questions

Best regards,
Mario Canales
