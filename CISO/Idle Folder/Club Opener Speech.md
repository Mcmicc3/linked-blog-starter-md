Project name: Idle Folder

Hello my name is Mario Canales, I'm the treasurer
Welcome all the new people curious and interested in cyber.

*Quick Bio?*
Information Systems and Technology Major with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
Senior on my last semester for my bachelors, however I'm planning on staying for my masters, and I transferred here from Fullerton College. 

This is also my very first Friday project, and for my project, I want to lead an introductory course in Active Directory

I felt that this is a very important subject to introduce in the CISO club, seeing that it is a subject that is missing in our education, because here at CSUSB and CISO, they teach us Linux system administration, but they don't really teach us that much Windows system administration. I don't know if it's because AD is considered "system administration" but it's unfortunate that they don't teach us for multiple reasons. one of them being that if you're a cyber IST major, you have to take the enterprise networking course, which is a capstone project where they're going to expect somebody in the group to configure AD to do things like manage an NTP Server, a DNS server, and general network & system hardening. 

I'm going to be honest with you. I personally don't have that much experience with AD or know a whole lot about it, but what I do know is that it's estimated to be used by 95% of fortune 500 companies. Which means, that statistically when I look around this room, whether you're interested in pursuing a career in blue team, or red team, it is very likely that most of you will either work directly or indirectly with AD. I can say this with confidence because AD is a main access control system that will be used by folks in blue teaming, whether you're analyzing an incident or setting up systems to do that, or using it to take back control. Either that, or you will be directly attacking AD to perform enumeration and ang gain escalated privileges in a network.

My goal for this project is to learn AD along with all of you, and gradually teach ourselves important key topics and fundamental concepts of AD to have a strong understanding of what it is and how it works. We're also going to learn generic and common applications of AD like setting up an email server to understand how that works, and we're also going to touch on some modern concepts like {Azure AD? Forgot name} so we can gain a better understanding of how AD is used today. As we progress through the different concepts, we're also going to be actively practicing these topics by installing Active Directory on machines so that by the end of it, you'll have a fully functional and working system that you can put on your resume, and hopefully demonstrate to a hiring manager. If we have time for it towards the end of the semester, I think it would be cool to setup an environment where can simulate an attack on an active directory environment, and then learn ways to both mitigate the problem to prevent it from happening in the first place, and resolve the issue in the moment, so what learn what it's like to take control and stop an active incident in it's tracks

If you're curious and interested, I would love to have you come and join us, where we can practice and learn this important topic together, thank you
