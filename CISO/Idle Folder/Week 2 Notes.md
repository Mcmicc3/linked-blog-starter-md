live database that stores user accounts and their passwords, computers, printers, file shares, security groups and their respective permissions

We use groups frequently for security purposes. It can work in conjunction with group policy to assign specific permissions for objects within AD. 

## Purpose of AD
Handles security authentication across the domain. 
- Only authorized users can logon to network computers

Centralized security management of network resources
- User accounts are stored in one place instead of each individual computer. 

## Common tasks 
Reset passwords 
Create / delete user accounts

# Without AD
You would need to create a local user account on each computer. If someone needed a pw reset, you had to go to each individual computer
- Imagine a situation where you're supposed to be able to log on from multiple devices, like school

## With AD
Centralized management
- Each individual computer that is part of the domain, queires active directory for the users password
- Saves tedious management

## Configuring a domain controller
#### What the hell is a domain controller?

A **Domain Controller (DC)** is a **server that manages authentication and security in an Active Directory (AD) domain**. It is responsible for verifying **user identities**, enforcing **security policies**, and controlling access to network resources.
##### Key Functions 
- **Authentication** üÜî
    
    - When users log in to their computers, the DC checks their credentials against the **Active Directory database**.
    - It uses **Kerberos** or **NTLM** authentication protocols.
- **Authorization** üîë
    
    - Once authenticated, the DC **grants or denies access** to shared files, printers, or applications based on **user permissions** and **group memberships**.
- **Active Directory Database Storage** üìÇ
    
    - The DC **stores and manages** the **NTDS.dit** database, which contains:
        - User accounts
        - Groups
        - Computers
        - Policies
        - Security settings
- **Enforces Group Policies (GPOs)** üèõ
    
    - A DC applies **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to enforce security settings (e.g., password policies, firewall rules, software restrictions).
- **Manages DNS for AD** üåé
    
    - AD **requires** DNS to function, and a DC often acts as a **DNS Server** to resolve domain-related queries.
- **Time Synchronization (NTP Server)** ‚è≥
    
    - The **Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator** in an AD environment ensures all devices have **synchronized clocks**, critical for Kerberos authentication.
- **Replication and Redundancy** üîÑ
    
    - In multi-DC environments, **domain controllers synchronize data** to ensure redundancy and high availability.

### Configuration steps

We're going to install Active Directory Domain Services, or ADS role. 
- Any server running the ADS role is considered a domain controller.

We need to add this role to our server to make it a domain controller.

1. Select manage then Add Roles and Features
2. Choose Role-Based or feature-based installation
3. Make sure the name of your PC is selected
4. In the services role, select Active Directory Domain Services Role
	1. Select the add features button if it pops up
5. We don't need any additional features, hit next
6. AD DS services, We're about to install DNS, hit next
7. Hit install and wait for installation to finish

Once this is done, select the flag with the triangle in the exclamation point, and click "Promote this server to a domain controller"

1. Wizard pop ups

**Things to note**:
- this is where we can create subdomains
- separates data and resources, separates logins
	- Example: CSUSB.EDU (admins & Developers), 
	- Courses.CSUSB.EDU (Students & Teachers)
- 

1. Change the option to select a new forest
