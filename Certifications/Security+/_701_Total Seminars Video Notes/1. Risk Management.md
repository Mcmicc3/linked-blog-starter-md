# Defining Business Risk

Assets

Vulnerability: Weaknesses or gaps in our security that allows threats to access our assets

Risk: Is the potential for a threat to exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to our assets

Change the rusty hinge to better protect our chest

- Minimizing the risk
- Understanding and protecting our assets
- Recognizing risk
- Addressing Vulnerabilities

#### CIA Security Triad
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability

#### Confidentiality
Ensures data is only accessible to those who have the authority to view it
Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches

#### Integrity
Ensures data remains unaltered and genuine
Without Integrity, systems and data can't be trusted

#### Availability
Ensures systems, applications, and data are available and operational when needed

# Threat Actors Part 1

Internal vs external

Funding: Someone on a budget? Or backed by government? 

Capability: Lots of people, or few?

Sophistication: Low and slow, or someone who does a drive b

Low from medium to High

#### Unskilled Hackers
Use readily available hacking tools
Not skilled, but can still cause damage
Also called "script kiddies"

**Always external. Funding, resources, capabilities and sophistication are on the low end**

#### Hacktivists
Hack for a cause
Want to promote a social or political agenda

hmmm....

#### Insider Threats
Internal employee or member of a company or organization
Their intimate knowledge makes them dangerous
![[Pasted image 20240609175432.png]]

#### Shadow IT
Unauthorized use of IT by employees
- Tools, software, apps, services, etc.
Can accidentally cause vulnerabilities
![[Pasted image 20240609175536.png]]

#### Application Allow List
Only allowed apps/software can be installed and used
Minimize malicious entities
Minimize vulnerabilities

# Threat Actors Part 2

#### Advanced Peristant Threats (APTs)
Attackers who are highly skilled, well-financed, and have a lot of time on their hands
Often backed by nation states
Attacks are prolonged, sophisticated, and stealthy
![[Pasted image 20240609180323.png]]
organized crimes, nation states, and competitors are examples 

#### Organized Crime 
Tightly-knit crew with a clear hierarchy
Organized, professional, profit-driven

![[Pasted image 20240609180428.png]]

#### Nation States
State- or government-sponsored
Sophisticated, resource-rich
Driven by espionage, destabilizing rivals, or political/economic/military advantage

# Threat Intelligence

#### Threat Intelligence Sources
Facilitate risk mangagement
Hardening can reduce incident response time
Provide cybersecurity insight
- Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
- Threat maps (Example: geographical representations of malware outbreaks)

threatmap.checkpoint.com

Close/proprietary 
OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
- Government reports
- Media 
- Academic papers

exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database

File/code repositories
- Example: GitHub
Vulnerabilitiy databases
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)

cve.mitre.org 

Dark Web/Dark Net
- Tor network, Tor Web browser
- Encrypted anonymous connections
- Not indexed by search engines
- Tor encryption and anonymity
	- Journalists
	- Law enforcement
	- Government informants

## Threat Intelligence Sharing

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) 
- Exchange of cybersecurity intelligence (CI) between entities

Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) 
- A form of AIS
- Data exchange format for cybersecurity intelligence

Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)
- Like RSS feed for threats
- Consists of TAXII servers and clients
- Real-time cyber intelligence feeds

# Risk Management Concepts

## Risk  Vector
Mission-critical IT systems
- Payment processing
- Human resources
- Emergency

Sensitive Data
- Do we know what we have and where it is?

Third-party access

## Physical Risk Vectors
Access control vestibules (mantraps)
Server room access
Limit USB bootable devices

## Risk Management Framework (RMFs)
Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- Cybersecurity best practices
NIST Risk Management
Framework (RMF)/Cybersecurity
Framework (CSF)
- Cybersecurity risk management

International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC)
- 27001/27002/27701/31000
	- IT system and information security

## Financial RMFs
Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements System and Organization Controls (SSAE SOC 2)
- Financial statement integrity
- Internal controls
- Type I and Type II

## RMFs
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Rev. 1
- "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments"

##  Data Privacy Regulations and Standards
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Protects EU citizens' private data
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Protect American patient medical information
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Protect cardholder information

## Types of Security Policies
Acceptable use policy (AUP)
- E-mail, social media, Web browsing
Resource access policies
- App or file access
Account policies
- Account hardening

Data retention policies 
- Often dictated by regulations
Change control policies
Asset management policies



# Security Controls
## Security Controls
Solution that mitigates threats 
- Example: Malware sacnner mitigates malware infections
Implemented differently based on platform/vendor/user
- Network infrastructure devices (switches, routers, firewalls)


# Risk Assessments and Treatments

# Quantitative Risk Assessments

# Qualitative Risk Assessments

# Security and the Information Life Cycle

# Data Destruction
