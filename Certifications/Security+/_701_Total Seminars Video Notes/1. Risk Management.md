# Defining Business Risk

Assets

Vulnerability: Weaknesses or gaps in our security that allows threats to access our assets

Risk: Is the potential for a threat to exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to our assets

#### CIA Security Triad
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability

#### Confidentiality
Ensures data is only accessible to those who have the authority to view it
Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches

#### Integrity
Ensures data remains unaltered and genuine
Without Integrity, systems and data can't be trusted

#### Availability
Ensures systems, applications, and data are available and operational when needed

# Threat Actors Part 1

Internal vs external

Funding: Someone on a budget? Or backed by government? 

Capability: Lots of people, or few?

Sophistication: Low and slow, or someone who does a drive b

Low from medium to High

#### Unskilled Hackers
Use readily available hacking tools
Not skilled, but can still cause damage
Also called "script kiddies"

**Always external. Funding, resources, capabilities and sophistication are on the low end**

#### Hacktivists
Hack for a cause
Want to promote a social or political agenda

hmmm....
![[Pasted image 20240609175339.png]]

#### Insider Threats
Internal employee or member of a company or organization
Their intimate knowledge makes them dangerous
![[Pasted image 20240609175432.png]]

#### Shadow IT
Unauthorized use of IT by employees
- Tools, software, apps, services, etc.
Can accidentally cause vulnerabilities
![[Pasted image 20240609175536.png]]

#### Application Allow List
Only allowed apps/software can be installed and used
Minimize malicious entities
Minimize vulnerabilities

# Threat Actors Part 2

#### Advanced Peristant Threats (APTs)
Attackers who are highly skilled, well-financed, and have a lot of time on their hands
Often backed by nation states
Attacks are prolonged, sophisticated, and stealthy
![[Pasted image 20240609180323.png]]
organized crimes, nation states, and competitors are examples 

#### Organized Crime 
Tightly-knit crew with a clear hierarchy
Organized, professional, profit-driven

![[Pasted image 20240609180428.png]]

#### Nation States
State- or government-sponsored
Sophisticated, resource-rich
Driven by espionage, destabilizing rivals, or political/economic/military advantage

Data retention policies 
- Often dictated by regulations
Change control policies
Asset management policies



# Security Controls
## Security Controls
Solution that mitigates threats 
- Example: Malware scanner mitigates malware infections
Implemented differently based on platform/vendor/user
- Network infrastructure devices (switches, routers, firewalls)

## Security Control Categories
### Managerial/Administrative
- What should eb done?
- Employee background checks
### Operational
- How often must we do it?
- Periodic Review of security policies
### Technical
- How exactly will we do it?
- Firewall rule configuration

## Security Control Types
### Physical 
- Access control vestibule (mantrap)
### Detective
- Log analysis
### Corrective
- Patching known vulnerabiltities
### Deterrent
- Device logon warning banners
### Compensating
- Network isolation for IoT devices
- 2nd pick., but still effective
- The problem is that some IoT programs are not secured. Therefore we need to **isolate** the devices

# Risk Assessments and Treatments

## Risk Assessment
" Prioritization of threats against assets and determining what to do about it"

#### Applicable to:
- Entire organization
- A single project or department

#### Targets:
- Servers
- Intellectual property (IP)
- Software licensing

## Risk Assessment Process
#### 1. Risk Awareness
- Cybersecurity intelligence sources

#### 2. Evaluate Security Controls
- Inherent (current) and residual risk

#### 3. Implement Security controls
#### 4. Periodic Review


## Risk Types

#### Environmental
- Flood, Hurricane
#### Person-made
- Riots, terrorism, sabotage
#### Internal
- Malicious insider, malware infections
#### External
- Distributed denial of service (DDOS)

## Risk Treatments
#### Mitigation/Reduction
- Security controls are proactively put in place before undertaking the risk

#### Transference/Sharing
- Some risk is transferred to a third party in exchange for payment
- Example: Cybersecurity insurance

#### Avoidance
- Avoid an activity becasue the risks outweigh potential gains
#### Acceptance
- The current level of risk is acceptable
- The risk falls within the organizations risk appetite

Consider a risk assessment
A sense of the different types of risks
And then how to treat or manage those risks

# Quantitative Risk Assessments

Getting a budget for technical controls is difficult.

## Quantitative Risk Assessment
#### Based on numeric values
#### Asset Value (AV)
#### Exposure Factor (EF)
- Percentage of asset value loss when negative incident occurs

## Single Loss Expectancy  (SLE)
How much loss is experiences during one negative incident?
Multiply asset value (AV) by the exposure factor (EF)

![[Pasted image 20240708233143.png]]

Asset value (**AV**) $24,000
**EF** = 12.5%

AV x EF = 3,000 (**SLE**)

## Calculate Single Loss Expectancy

![[Pasted image 20240708233327.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240708233511.png]]

## Quantitative Risk Assessment
#### Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO)
- Expected number of yearly occurnaces
- Example: 2-3 times per year

#### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
- Total yearly cost of bad things happening
- ALE = SLE x ARO


### Exam Tip
Know how to calculate the SLE and the ALE

## Calculate Annualized Loss Expectancy
![[Pasted image 20240708233758.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240708233847.png]]

- We're calculating this to see how much we're spending annually to correct these issues

# Qualitative Risk Assessments

## Qualitative Risk Assessment
#### Based on subjective opinions regarding:
- Threat likelihood
- Impact of realized threat
- #### Threates are given a severity rating

## Risk Register
#### Organizations should have one (or more) Centralized list of risks, severities, responsibilities, and mitigations

#### Generally considered qualititaive
- Example: severity or impact ratings
- Occasionally includes hard numbers (%, $)

![[Pasted image 20240708234110.png]]

## Risk Heat Map
Take risk severity levels and map visually by color
![[Pasted image 20240708234159.png]]

#### Risk Matrix
Table of risk details
Similar to a heat map but without colors


# Security and the Information Life Cycle

## Information Life Cycle
#### Security involved at every phase
#### Data Collection
- Consent
#### Implementation depends on regulations/standards

![[Pasted image 20240708234837.png]]

## Personally Identifiable Inforamtion (PII)
#### One or more pieces of sensitive information that can be traced back to an individual
- Social Security numbers 
- E-mail address
- Credit card number
- Home address
- Web browser cookie containing sensitive session identifiers

#### One or more pieces of sensitive medical information that can be traces back to an individual
- Health insurance plan number
- Blood type 
- Patient medical ailments

## Privacy-Enhancing Technologies
Anonymization 

The **GDPR allows anonymized** **data** collection and use **without user consent**

Anonymized data has limited marketing value

## Anonymization Techniques
#### Pseudo-anonymization
- Replace PII with fake identifiers
#### Data minimization
- Limit stored/retained sensitive data

#### Tokenization
- A digital token authorizes access instead of the original credentials
#### Data Masking
- Hide sensitive data from unauthorized users
- Masked out credit card number digits on a receipt

## Data Sovereignty
#### Location of data and laws that apply to it
- Where did the data originate?
- Where does the data reside?
- Which laws/regulations apply to the data?

**You even have to consider where your data is being backed up. Be mindful of where your data is backed up when using cloud providers like Microsoft Azur **

![[Pasted image 20240709001233.png]]

# Data Destruction

## Data Destruction
#### Paper, film, magnetic tape
- Burning
- Pulping
- Shredding (pulverizing)

##  Digital Data Destruction
#### Failed or decommissioned storage devices
#### Storage device end-of-life policies
- Reuse? Donate? Destroy?
- Update asset inventory

## Digital Media Sanitization

#### Data is still recoverable
- Deleted files, repartitioned, or reformatted drives
#### Disk wiping tools
- SSD and HD
	- Multiple pass disk overwrites
- HD only
	- Degaussing

![[Pasted image 20240709005123.png]]

## Digital Media Sanitization
#### Cryptographic erasure
- Destroy storage media decryption key
- Self-encrypting drives (SEDs)
