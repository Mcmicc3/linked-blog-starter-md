# Shells

## Command Line Environments
#### Types of environments
- Windows Command Line
- Microsoft PowerShell
- Linux Shells
- Python

#### Benefits
- Automation via scripts
- *Windows TaskScheduler*

## Reverse Shells
Attackers often try to get a reverse shell (backdoor)
- Netcat
*Trick the victim to run the netcat command
![[Pasted image 20240710163129.png]]

*When netcat runs on the victims machine, it points to the IP address of the attacker station, and force it to run a shell. The victim machines is where it run , but it's available on the attacker station now.
![[Pasted image 20240710163411.png]]
*It's easy to read these books and learn how to evade antivirus software*

## Reverse Shells
#### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
- Attacker has a way into the system repeadetedly
#### Tools
- netcat (nc)
- Metasploit framework
- Cobalt Strike

Standard shells are for legitimate use
Reverse shells are for nefarious use

# The Windows Command Line

## Windows Command Line
#### Run program using cmd.exe
- May need to run with elevated privileges

#### Batch file scripts
- File extensions is .bat

##### Commands
- whoami
- hostname
- notepad
	- *He created a notepad and entered commands, then named it something with .bat*
![[Pasted image 20240710163858.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240710163934.png]]

##### command
- set
- *Shows the environment variables*
![[Pasted image 20240710164031.png]]
*He created an environmental variable called fav_color with a value*
![[Pasted image 20240710164058.png]]

##### Command
- powershell
![[Pasted image 20240710164134.png]]

# Microsoft PowerShell
Used to be called Windows powershell

## Microsoft PowerShell
Can run in Windows, Linux, ,macOS
Powershell.exe
Object-oriented
May need to run with elevated privileges
Powershell scripts
- File extension is .ps1

*Powershell uses libraries of commands you can issue called modules. You can get a list of loaded modules in memory with `get-module`*

*If you can want to see all of them installed, use `get-module -list`*
![[Pasted image 20240710165239.png]]

*You can manage the cloud from powershell*
- cloudshell
![[Pasted image 20240710165358.png]]
*You can run powershell commands that don't normally run on loo*

*This command shows you a list of azure virtual machines: `get-azvm`* 
![[Pasted image 20240710165536.png]]

*You can search for commands with certain characters, or words in the command with this: `get-command *disk*`*
- star is a wildcard
*Tons of commands related to disk*
![[Pasted image 20240710165715.png]]
*You can narrow it down to search for physical disk with `get-command *phsyicaldisk*`*
![[Pasted image 20240710165815.png]]
*We found a command that shows the physical disk. Each disk is an object*
![[Pasted image 20240710165841.png]]
*This command shows services running: `get-service`*
![[Pasted image 20240710165921.png]]

*Piping results. Example: `get-service | where{$_.status -eq "running"}`*
- The where command
- The $_ checks every variable ![[Pasted image 20240710172517.png]]

*Lets look for the name type of disk, and size. Example: `get-physicaldisk | select friendlyname, mediatype, size`*
![[Pasted image 20240710172654.png]]

*Import command that determines whether powershell scripts are allowed to execute on this machine: `get-executionpolicy`*
![[Pasted image 20240710172845.png]]

We learned how to automate and how it's object oriented.

# Linux Shells

## Linux Shells
#### Syntax is case-sensitive
#### Various types of shells
- C shell
- Korn shell
- Bourne again shell (bash)
#### Shell scripts (.sh)
- Must be flagged as executable

#### Don't sign in with root account
#### sudo command prefix
- Runs commands with elevated privileges
- User must be listed in sudoers
#### Remotely accessible
- Secure Shell (SSH) over TCP port 22

*We need to know how to generate a public and private key pair through the Linux shell to use SSH*

`ssh-keygen -t rsa`
- With -t, we're generating a rsa keypair
- Key file for device
- It will ask you to save the file, it names it by default 'id_rsa'
- You only need to password protect private keys
![[Pasted image 20240710175701.png]]
*It made 2 files. id_rsa (private) and id_rsa.pub.(public)*
- public keys need to be on the linux host

*If we run ls -a, we can find the .ssh hidden directory which will display the public and private key pair*
![[Pasted image 20240710180015.png]]
*Now we're going to redirect the public key to another file called authorized keys*
- We do this with `cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys`
![[Pasted image 20240710180151.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240710180301.png]]
*We can automate this same function with the command: `ssh-copy-id`*

*Mount command can mount a subdirectory to either a disk, or remotely to something shared on the network*
- Almost like drives, except in Linux they're called mount points

*He got this output by running: `mount`*
![[Pasted image 20240710180536.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240710180603.png]]

*Talks about `ifconfig, ping and ip a`*


# Network Scanners
Can be used legitimately to see devices on the network and what services they're running

## Network Scanners
#### Attackers use this for reconnaissance
#### Very loud on the network (easily detected)
#### Scan network nodes and show
- IP address
- MAC address
- Operating system
- Open ports

#### Periodic scans
- Identify differences (rogue systems, new listening ports)

##### NMAP & Zenmap
- Zenmap is a front end GUI of NMAP
![[Pasted image 20240710182204.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240710182228.png]]

# Network Scanning with Nmap
run the `nmap` command to determined if it's installed on the PC

mentioned `ipconfig` to determine addresses that are being used

Running NMAP is not illegal, but gathering versions to find vulnerabilities can be illegal

`nmap -V` is for verbose mode. We then give it an IP range
-  It's finding open ports
![[Pasted image 20240710185021.png]]

*We can also do OS fingerprinting with: `nmap -o 192.168.4.1`*
![[Pasted image 20240710185117.png]]
*Notice that there's extra ports like universal plug n play, which is commonly found in consumer grade routers. Which may suggest that it's a honeypot

*Now we're going to do the same thing with zenmap.*
- He entered a range: 192.168.4.1 - 192.168.4.5
- He made a quick scan
![[Pasted image 20240710185444.png]]
- He switched over to the scans tab to see the current scan running
- You can also remove scans, and enter your own scan files
![[Pasted image 20240710185916.png]]
*On the left, we see a range of IPs we asked to scan. We can pick any particular host, and on the right we'll see the ports that are open

![[Pasted image 20240710190010.png]]

*There is a tab called services that switches the view to services being run on the network instead of hosts, and then shows you which devices are using these services*
![[Pasted image 20240710190430.png]]

*There's also a topology view. Each circle represents a host. The bigger the circle means more services being run on that host*
![[Pasted image 20240710190935.png]]


These tools should be ran periodically to determine if there has been any changes made to the network

# Network Protocol Analyzers

Could be a device, software...

## Network Protocol Analyzers
#### Capture network traffic
- Network placement is crucial
- Hardware device or software
- Network switch port analyzer (**SPAN**) copies all VLAN traffic to one switch port

#### Wired and wireless capturing
#### Captures can be saved
#### Packets are easily forged with free tools such as hping3

Don't believe everything you see, because that traffic can easily be fooled
- Tools like **hping3** let you spoof everything in the packet. Including the header, and the payload

#### Filer and analyze captured traffic
- Capture and display filters
- View packet headers (addressing)
- View packet payload (data)
- Analyze TCP streams

## Network Protocol Anaylzers
#### tcpdump in Linux
#### Cisco NetFlow
- Capture IP traffic on routers
- Similar to the sFlow standard
- Superseded by IPFIX standard

![[Pasted image 20240710194157.png]]



# Using Wireshark to Analyze Network Traffic 

You're only going to see network traffic depending on where you're connected.

*Bottom half of the screen shows network adaptors on this device
![[Pasted image 20240710205046.png]]
Click on the network adaptor to see the traffic*

*Talks about source and destination ports shown on packets*
![[Pasted image 20240710205239.png]]

*Is it illegal to collect this info and analyze it later if you got it from an airport? No

*Talks about filtering through protocols like http*
- Mentioned that you can search for strings like password
- Then follow the stream

![[Pasted image 20240710205327.png]]
*This is what happens when you use websites that use http*
![[Pasted image 20240710205723.png]]


# Using tcpdump to Analyze Network Traffic

`man tcpdump`

*Capturing things on a given network interface. We figure that out with `ifconfig`. Here he's capturing eth0*

-   *ran this command with: `sudo tcpdump -i eth0`*
![[Pasted image 20240710214503.png]]
*Capturing packets*
- Got out with ctrl + c

*Next, he's looking for traffic coming from a specific source. From this name or this IP address. He did this with the command:  `sudo tcpdump src 76.11.78.0`:
![[Pasted image 20240710215943.png]]
We're seeing SSH traffic because we're SSHed in 

*We can see traffic going to CNN and save it to a file. He did this with the command: `sudo tcpdump -X dst www.cnn.com -w cnn_traffic`*
- The -X flag will show us the details in the packets
- dst stands for destination
- The -w flag writes to a file

*This is now happening in the foreground, preventing us from doing anything else. We need to run this in the background*
![[Pasted image 20240710220221.png]]
*We can do this by adding an apersand `&` to the end of the command*
- `sudo tcpdump -X dst www.cnn.com -w cnn_traffic`
*We can verify the command is running in the background with the `jobs` command.*

*We can retrieve the html file for the homepage of CNN using `wget`*
![[Pasted image 20240710220509.png]]

*To bring jobs to the foreground we run `fg 1`*
- 1 is the ID for the job running

![[Pasted image 20240710220603.png]]

*We can read the save captured file with `sudo tcpdump -r cnn_traffic`*

# Log Files

## Log Files
#### Network, host, and device monitoring
#### Potential indicators of compromise (IoC)
#### Must ensure log files are secure
- Forward log entries to a centralized logging host

## Log Tools
#### Windows Log Tools
- Event Viewer
- PowerShell
	- -get-eventlog
#### Linux Logs
- /var/log
- logger
- journalctl
#### Device Logs
- Network printer, wireless AP, etc

##### Event Viewer
![[Pasted image 20240710223752.png]]

*Inside event viewer, there is a tab for security underneath the Windows Logs folder.*
![[Pasted image 20240710223906.png]]
*You can right click it and filter for logs with `file current log`*
![[Pasted image 20240710223943.png]]

*Operational logs related to group policy in Windows*
![[Pasted image 20240710224110.png]]

*In Linux, we find logs in `ls /var/log`*
![[Pasted image 20240710224229.png]]

*To view the first 10 lines of log file we run: `ls /var/log/kern.log`*
![[Pasted image 20240710224304.png]]

*We can also search for specific logs like this: `cat /var/log/syslog | grep "Dan"`*
![[Pasted image 20240710224427.png]]


# Centralized Logging
## Centralized Logging
#### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- Bandwidth monitoring
- Software agent or built into firmware
	- Management Information Base (MIB)
- SNMP traps notify SNMP management stations

## Linux Centralized Logging
#### Syslog/rsyslog
#### Normally uses UDP port 514
#### Filter traffic that gets sent

![[Pasted image 20240710231213.png]]
- The devices sending log events don't need to be Linux

## Windows Centralized Logging
#### Event Viewer subscriptions
- Send local log data to a collector server over the WinRM protocol
- You can configure it to send critical warnings

![[Pasted image 20240710231350.png]]
- WinRM Protocol


*You can configure the direction of how data is being sent to the log collector server. Notice the change of direction in the **arrows***

#### Enterprise-level centralized log ingestion service
#### Dashboard visualizations
- Alerts, packet captures, malware alerts, etc.
- Identify trends and correlation

## SIEM Process
#### Data inputs
#### Log aggregation
#### Analysis
#### Review reports

*Showing an example of alienvault siem*

# Cybersecurity Benchmark Tools

We adjust our defenses and strategy based on benchmark results and standards

## Benchmarks
#### Industry-leading security configuration standards
#### Define minimum level of security to meet standards or regulatory requirements

## NIST Guidelines
#### National Institute of Standards and Technology
#### Technical guidelines for federal agencies and other organizations
- www.nist.gov

### Five sections of NIST
1. Identify
2. Protect
3. Detect
4. Respond
5. Recover
- Life cycle of what we need to understand to survive in cybsersecurity

## CIS
#### Center for Internet Security
#### Best practices for securely configuring a system

## Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) 

Imagine securing an enterprise with various doors, windows, and vents. We set standards for how to protect every room
![[Pasted image 20240710233948.png]]
Now imagine doing it for several enterprises
![[Pasted image 20240710234010.png]]

We can automate these standards

## Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
#### Collection of standards
#### Maintain the security of systems by automatically finding vulnerabilities in real-time
- Think of it as a digital watchdog

## Benchmark types
#### Agent-based
#### Agentless


## Agent-Based
1. Software installed on devices to monitor and protect them 
2. Continuous surveillance and action
3. Identify and handle security threats
4. Ensure organizational security policy compliance

## Agentless
1. Don't require software on each device
2. Less intrusive
3. Less impact on system performance
4. Rely on network connection
5. Can scan for vulnerabilities without direct system access


# Configuring Linux Log Forwarding

*Receive log entry sent from other Linux hosts. Did this with `sudo nano /etc/rsyslong.conf`*

*He uncommented lines that refer to udp connectivity*
![[Pasted image 20240711000920.png]]

*Now we need to restart the syslog service. Did this with` sudo service rsyslog restart`*
*Sometimes you get errors from services, and the only way to check is to look at the status. We do this with `sudo service rsyslog status`*
![[Pasted image 20240711001330.png]]
*We're good

*This will confirm if the service is running and where it's listening:
`sudo netstat -tnlpu | grep rsyslog`*
- -n for numeric
- -u for udp
![[Pasted image 20240711001451.png]]

*This PCs ip is 10.1.15. He then moved to a different host. On the other host, we need to edit rsyslog but do something else.*
*He added a line that tells the machine where to send logs. He entered `kern.warn [enter] *.* @10.1.1.5`*
![[Pasted image 20240711001734.png]]
*He then restarted the service: `sudo service rsyslog restart`*
*Then: `sudo service rsyslog status`*

*Now he's using logger to create his own log entry*
*He typed `logger "Dan testing log forwarding"`.*
*Followed by `tail /var/log/syslog`*
![[Pasted image 20240711001939.png]]

*He then went back to the first PC, ran the same command, and we can see it*

**If we lose a system, we can still view logs from that downed unit, because we configured log forwarding**
