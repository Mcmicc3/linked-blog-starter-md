# Malware

## Malware
Software that is detrimental to the operation of a host

## Virus
#### Program that can replicate only through definite user interaction
#### Activates once a user clicks or downloads 
#### Fileless malware/virus
- No file, lives only in memory
- Difficult for anti-malware to detect

## Ransomware
#### Cryptomalware/crypto-ransomeware
- Uses encryption to lock a user out of a system
#### Attacker hides your data until you pay a ransom

## Worm
#### Virus that, once started, replicates itself
#### More like a pathway for replication

## Trojan Horse
#### A program that looks benign, but in fact hides a nefarious program inside it
#### No replication by themselves
#### Remote access Trojan (RAT) 
- Maliciously takes control of a system remotely

## Backdoor
#### Not nevessarily nefarious
#### Created by developers as easy maintenance entry point
#### Can be exploited by attackers if left open by developers
#### Can be created in a program by hackers to gain access

## Potential Unwanted Programs (PUPs)
#### Software that may have negative or undesirable effects
#### Crapware, adware, spyware, bloatware


## Bots/Botnets
#### Distributeed attack using remotely controlled malware controlling several computers
- Often running some kind of RAT
#### Hosts are called bots or zombies
#### One kind of botnet attack is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
- Overload of traffic that makes resources unavailable for legitimate users

#### Command and control (C2/C&C)
- Protocols that automate the control, not requiring human interaction after the initial programming

## Keylogger
#### Hardware
- Device that plugs in between keyboard and computer to log keystrokes
- Many have WAPs built in for remote access

#### Software
- Program that logs keystrokes
- Example: monitoring kids' activity on the computer
- Most anti-malware can find nefarious software keyloggers

## Rootkit
#### Can often be somewhat invisible
#### Goal is to get root access to a system
#### Usually installed on the boot of the systems they're attacking

## Logic Bomb
#### Often a script set to execute
#### Created with a timer to go off at a specific time or during a specific event on a system


# Weak Configurations

## Weak Configurations
#### On-Premises vs. Cloud Solutions
#### Open permissions
- Open wireless networks
- Guest user accounts
- No intruder lockout settings
- Too many file or app permissions

## Weak Configuration Example
#### Linux root account
- Don't sign in with root account
- Use sudo to run privileged commands
- Disallow remote access as root
- Use su to temporarily switch to root

Change the root password with `sudo passswd root`

## Insecure Cryptographic Solutions
#### Wi-Fi Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- Use WPA2 or WPA3

#### Digital Encryption Standard (DES)
- Use AES

#### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Use TLS

#### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Not secure
	- Versions 1.0 and 1.1
- Secure
	- Versions 1.2 and 1.3

## Change Default Settings
#### IP address
#### Open port numbers
#### Web server root filesystem location
- Directory traversal attacks
#### Username/password policies


# Common Attacks

## Zero-Day (0-Day) Attacks
#### An exploit unknown by the vendor and the public
#### Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)
- Encourages the private reporting of vulnerabilities to vendors
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240711180235.png]]
Bug bounty programs

## Common Attacks
#### DNS sinkholing
- Return false DNS query results
- DNS poisoning? 
#### Privilege escalation
- Attacker acquires a higher level of access
- Example: compromising an admin account that has a weak password
#### Replay attack
- Attacker intercepts and later retransmits or uses sensitive data
- Often called man-in-the-middle attack or onpath attack

#### Pointer/object dereference
- Attacker manipulates memory pointers to point to unexpected memory locations
- Normally causes software to crash (DoS attack)
 
#### Error handling
- Improper handling can crash a system
- Disclosure of too much information

#### Dynamic Link Library injection(DLL)
- Attacker places malicious DLL in the file system
- Legitimate running processes call malicious code within the DLL

#### Resource exhaustion
- Dos or DDoS
- Memory Leaks

#### Race conditions
- **Specific to multi threaded applications**
- Code runtime phenomenon
- Action that might occur before security control is in effect
- Based on timing

# Overflow Attacks
Buffer overflows

## Memory injections
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240711185655.png]]
Unauthorized code gets placed into a programs running memory.

## Buffer overflows
Focuses on code running in memory
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240711185743.png]]
A buffer is the glass, data is the water, if an app receives too much data, it will overflow and spill into other parts of the program, creating problems in memory. 


## Processor attacks

Multiple program instructions are happening at the same time. Order they're happening will change the results 
Imagine two people trying to unlock the door at the same time.  One might think the door is locked, while the other opens it
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240711185900.png]]


## Time of check and time of use
Looking at a book on Amazon.
You reserve the book, but the time you go to use the book, it's already taken

From the time you reserved the book, and the time you go to use, somebody else already checked it out.

Hackers exploit the gaps between checking and using. 

## Race condition
Can result in privilege escalation.

# Password Attacks

## Online vs Offline

#### Tools
- John the Ripper
- Cain and Abel
- Hydra
#### Dictionary
- Uses common username/password files
- Tries thousands or millions of likely possibilities to login to a user account

## Password Attacks
#### Brute-force
- Try every possible combination of characters
#### Multiple attempts should trigger an account lockout

## Password Spraying
#### Blast many accounts wiht a best-guess common password before trying a new password
#### Slower (per-user account basis) than traditional attacks
#### Less likely to trigger account lockout thresholds


# Bots and Botnets

## Bots and Botnets
#### Bot
- Single infected device under attacker control
- AKA "zombie"
#### Botnet
- Collection of infected devices under an attackers control

## Bots
#### Periodically talks to a command and control (C2/C&C) attacker server
- Mitigate with IDS
- Attacker might have directions stored in a DNS TXT record
	- Network IDS might detect this

## Command and Control Bot
*Bot communicates with the C&C server through the Tor network*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240712183221.png]]

*We're going to look at a suspicious packet where a device is querying for a DNS TXT record

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240712183357.png]]
*Not normal*

*Uploading packet capture to this website to find abnormalities*

*Notice that a bunch of AV solutions aren't seeing anything, but Snort did

# Disk RAID Levels

## Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)
#### Groups of disks together to work as one
- Better performance
- Data high availability
#### Hardware RAID controller
#### Software RAID
- Slower and less reliable than hardware RAID

**Availability**

## Storage Area Network (SAN)
Storage out on a network

## Storage Area Network (SAN) Multipathing
Each server is configured with a **Host bus adapter**, which allows connectivity to the SAN, usually fiber.

## RAID 0 - Striping
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240712231026.png]]
- Performance benefit
- Lose one disk, lose everything 

## RAID 1 - Mirroring
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240712231127.png]]

## RAID 5 - Striping with Distributed Parity
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240712231251.png]]
- Get the performance benefit of striping
- Parity is written across each disk
- Can handle one disk failure

## RAID
#### RAID 6
- Requires at least 4 disks
- Stores 2 parity stripes on each disk
- Can tolerate failures of 2 disks

#### RAID 10
- RAID level 1, then 0
- Disk mirroring, then striping
- Requires at least 4 disks
