# Testing Infrastructure Overview
#### Three big areas where we look for vulnerabilities
1.  Hardware
	1. CPUs, processors, cameras
2. Configuration
	1. Weak configuration
3. Management
	1. Not training users

Social engineering

AI is a problem today
- If you have a database, you can create a malware to attack databases, and use artificial to make the malware do interesting things
- *Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI)*

## Security assessment

#### Vulnerability assessment
Pentest
- Internal vulnerability test

# Social Engineering Attacks

## Social Engineering Tactics
#### Impersonation
- Exploiting peoples trust
#### Urgency
#### Misinformation/disinformation


## Social Engineering Attacks
#### Vector
#### Attack Surface

## Phishing
#### Vector
- E-mail
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting e-mail user

## Vishing (Voice Phishing)
#### Vector
- Phone call
#### Attack surface
- Targeted individual

## Smishing (SMS Phishing)
#### Vector
- SMS text or direct message
#### Attack Surface
- Mobile phone or app
## Business E-mail Compromise
#### Vector
- Business e-mail
- *Email has been hacked into*
#### Attack surface
- Partners and clients of the employee who get targeted

## Pretexting
#### Vector
- Various: phone, e-mail, app, etc.
- *Fabricated and elaborate stories*
- *Recorded call from an IRS agent with a warrant for your arrest*
#### Attack surface
- Individuals or businesses

## Watering Hole
#### Vector
- Well-known website
- *Well known website that was compromised by attackers*
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting website user

## Brand Impersonation
#### Vector
- Usually e-mail or social media
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting people who trust the misrepresented brand

## Typo Squatting
#### Vector
- Website URLs
#### Attack surface
- People who mistype a web address

# Vulnerability Assessments

## Vulnerability Scans
#### Compare to baseline scans
- Take a baseline scan of our network
#### Passive/non-invasive compared to penetration tests
#### Should be run periodically
- Manual 
- Automatic (scheduled)

## Vulnerability Scan Targets
#### Network
#### Host
#### Application
- ZAP

## Vulnerability Scans
#### Credentialed scan
- Tester provides host/device credentials
- Testing is more thorough
- *Provide vulnerability scanning tool with credentials to access devices*
#### Non-credentialed
- Mimic someone who doesn't have access
- *Doesn't include the credentials in a vulnerability scan*
#### Keep vulnerabilities database up-to-date
- Reduces false negatives/positives

*GFILanguard. It's got database update options. *

**Exam Tip:**
I might get asked to do a vulnerability scan without actively exploiting them. The answer is a **vulnerability assessment**, because a pentest would actively exploit them . 
# Penetration Testing

## Penetration Testing

##### AKA "pen testing"
##### Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
##### Invasive/active compared to vulnerability assessments
- Vulnerability assessment is passive
- Pentest is active
##### Pen tester must sign non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
- Business impact documents, and memorandums of understandings are **not legally binding documents**

##### Normally triggers IDS/IPS alerts
- Find out if alarm bells are triggering when they're supposed to
##### Known (White box)
##### Unknown (black box)
##### Partially-known (Gray box)
##### Bug bounty
- Offered by vendors for discovery of zero-day attacks



## Pen Testing Exercises
#### Red team
- Attackers
#### Blue Team
- Defenders
#### White team
- Manages red and blue team engagements
#### Purple team
- Red and blue team feedback and knowledge transfer
![[Pasted image 20240719215541.png]]
1. Rules of engagement
	1. Cloud providers have their own rules for pentesting
	2. For private companies, a lawyer needs to certify what is agreed upon
2. Discovery enumeration
	1. What tools are you using
3. Vulnerability Identification and exploitation
4. Privilege escalation, backdoors, pivoting, lateral movement
5. Cleanup
6. Report findings

# The Metasploit Framework

## The Metasploit Framework
#### Cross-platform command-line tool used for penetration testing
- Built into Kali Linux
- Armitage GUI can also be used
- Rapid7 provides a vulnerable VM for testing
	- Metasploitable
#### Keeps exploits up-to-date with the msfupdate command
#### Payloads
- Used to interact with compromised devices

#### Can't block ports 80 and 443
#### Black hole routing

**Exam Tip**
We need to know when to use the metaplsoit framework
- It's used for exploiting vulnerabilities
