# Testing Infrastructure Overview

# Social Engineering Attacks

## Social Engineering Tactics
#### Impersonation
#### Urgency
#### Misinformation/disinformation

## Social Engineering Attacks
#### Vector
#### Attack Surface

## Phishing
#### Vector
- E-mail
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting e-mail user

## Vishing (Voice Phishing)
#### Vector
- Phone call
#### Attack surface
- Targeted individual

## Smishing (SMS Phishing)
#### Vector
- SMS text or direct message
#### Attack Surface
- Mobile phone or app
## Business E-mail Compromise
#### Vector
- Business e-mail
#### Attack surface
- Partners and clients of the employee who get targeted

## Pretexting
#### Vector
- Various: phone, e-mail, app, etc.
#### Attack surface
- Individuals or businesses

## Watering Hole
#### Vector
- Well-known website
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting website user

## Brand Impersonation
#### Vector
- Usually e-mail or social media
#### Attack surface
- Unsuspecting people who trust the misrepresented brand

## Typo Squatting
#### Vector
- Website URLs
#### Attack surface
- People who mistype a web address

# Vulnerability Assessments

## Vulnerability Scans
#### Compare to baseline scans
#### Passive/non-invasive compared to penetration tests
#### Should be run periodically
- Manual 
- Automatic (scheduled)

## Vulnerability Scan Targets
#### Network
#### Host
#### Application


## Vulnerability Scans
#### Credentialed scan
- Tester provides host/device credentials
- Testing is more thorough
#### Non-credentialed
- Mimic someone who doesn't have access
#### Keep vulnerabilities database up-to-date
- Reduces false negatives/positives
# Penetration Testing

## Penetration Testing

##### AKA "pen testing"
##### Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
##### Invasive/active compared to vulnerability assessments
##### Pen tester must sign non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
##### Normally triggers IDS/IPS alerts

##### Known (White box)
##### Unknown (black box)
##### Partially-known (Gray box)
##### Bug bounty
- Offered by vendors for discovery of zero-day attacks

## Pen Testing Exercises
#### Red team
- Attackers
#### Blue Team
- Defenders
#### White team
- Manages red and blue team engagements
#### Purple team
- Red and blue team feedback and knowledge transfer

# The Metasploit Framework

## The Metasploit Framework
#### Cross-platform command-line tool used for penetration testing
- Built into Kali Linux
- Armitage GUI can also be used
- Rapid7 provides a vulnerable VM for testing
	- Metasploitable
#### Keeps exploits up-to-date with the msfupdate command
#### Payloads
- Used to interact with compromised devices

#### Can't block ports 80 and 443
#### Black hole routing
