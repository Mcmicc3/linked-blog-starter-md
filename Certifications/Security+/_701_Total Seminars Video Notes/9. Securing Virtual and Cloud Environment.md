# Defending a Public Server



# Common Attacks and Mitigations

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
#### Botnets
#### Network/app flooding
#### Low and slow attacks 
#### Mitigation
- Throttling 
- Blackhole routing
	- Trying to figure out bad traffic, and routing it to nowhere

## DDoS Attack

## URL Hikacking/ Redirecting
#### Stems from
- User typos that result in redirection to similar URL
- Tainted search results redirect to a malicious site
#### Also called "typosquatting"

## Session Replay Attacks
#### Attacker takes over user session
- Cookie
- URL
- HTML form field
#### Cookie mitigation
- Set HTTPOnly flag
	- Disallows JavaScript cookie access

## Pass-the-Hash Attacks
##### Take advantage of password hashes
##### Attacker compromises system with user login session
##### Attacker uses the hash to gain access to other network resources

## Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)
#### Security as a Service (SECaaS)
#### Cybersecurity outsourcing
- 24x7 remote security monitoring
- Vulnerability assessments
- Pen tests
- Report generation

# Containers and Software-Defined Networking

## Application Containers
#### App components are managed as a single unit
#### Microservices/API
- App component decoupling
#### Can be accessible over the network
- Example: TCP port 80 for a Web site

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240718205445.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721164628.png]]
- Press q to quit
*Pull an image called alpine*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721164812.png]]
*Verify that it's there*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721164826.png]]
- It's available locally
*Run container with this*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721164855.png]]
- i is for interactive mode
- t is for terminal
*Notice that it gave us a linux prompt*
- Any subdirectories are local to the container

*Pulling an image named caddy*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721173804.png]]

*This is to have a docker image running in the background. We're making this container available through port 80*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721173917.png]]

*If we run ifconfig we can see the IP for the docker host*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721173958.png]]

*You need to understand how containers work and how they interact with the OS*

## Software-Defined Network (SDN)
#### Facilitates network management
- Command line
- GUI
#### Hide underlying network configuration complexities
- Vnets
- Subnets
- VPNs

# Hypervisors and Virtual Machines

## Hypervisors 
#### OS that manages virtual machine guests
#### On-premise hypervisor
- Full configuration control
#### Cloud hypervisors 
- Limited control

*If something bad happens to Hypervisor on premise, you can have it run on the cloud instead*
#### Type 1
- Bare-metal
- It is the OS
#### Type 2
- Runs as an app within the OS

## Virtual Machines Vulnerabilities
#### Same as host hardening
- Still have to install patches
- Disable unused accounts/services
#### VM sprawl
- Attacker breaks out of VM to hypervisor
#### VM escape
- Attacker breaks out of VM to hypervisor

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240718215121.png]]

##  VM Hardening
#### Disable unnecessary components
#### Use complex passwords and MFA
#### Limit public Internet visibility
#### Encrypt the VM


# Cloud Deployment Models

## Cloud Computing
#### Running IT services on somebody else's equipment over a network
#### Thin vs. thick client
#### Fog/edge computing
- Storage/compute at network perimeter
- Reduces network latency

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240718221733.png]]

## Cloud Computing Characteristics
##### Pooled resources
##### Broad acccess
- Access it over the network from any device
##### Self-service provisioning
- You can spin up a machine on your own without a ticket
##### Rapid elasticity
##### Metered usage

## Public Cloud
##### Anybody can sign up for an account
##### Cloud tenant isolation
##### Ongoing monthly expenses (OPEX) 
##### Shared IT responsibility depending on service

## Private Cloud
##### Cloud is owned and used by a single organization
##### Requires an up-front capital investment (CAPEX)
##### Organization assumes full hardware/software responsibility

## Hybrid Cloud 
##### Combines public and private clouds
##### Public cloud can be used as an alternate disaster recovery site

## Community Cloud
##### Cloud computing for organizations/ agencies with similar cloud computing needs
##### Example:
- Microsoft Azure Government Cloud



# Cloud Service Models

## Cloud Service Models
#### Categories of cloud services offerings
#### Shared responsibility
- Cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for hardware
- CSP may be responsible for software configurations
- Cloud tenant may be responsible for software configurations

## Anything as a Service (XaaS)
##### An IT service that is accessible remotely over a network
##### IT services run on provider infrastructure
##### Adheres to cloud computing characteristics

## Common Cloud Service Models
#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
##### Storage
##### Networking
##### Manually deployed and managed virtual machines
##### Do not expose directly to the internet where possible
##### CSP responsibility
- Hardware
##### Cloud tenant responsibility
- VM and storage account deployment, hardening

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
#### Databases
#### Software developer tools
#### Underlying virtual machines are managed by the provider
- Managed service
- Serverless

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
#### End-user productivity software
#### CSP responsibility
- Hardware
- Virtual machines
- Software installation and patching
#### Cloud tenant responsibility
- Software configuration
- User provisioning



# Securing the Cloud

## CSP Cloud Security Responsibility
#### Hardware
- Power
- HVAC
- Hardware configuration
- Firmware updates
#### Software 
- PaaS and SaaS

## Cloud Tenant Security Responsibility
#### Internet connection to the public cloud
- Redundant network links to CSP
#### Cross-region replication
- Increases high availability
	- Virtual machines
	- Storage accounts

## Cloud Security Controls
#### Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
- Enforces security policies when accessing cloud resources
- Normally done via proxying

## Cloud Security Controls
#### Next-generation secure web gateway (SWG)
- CASB functionality
- Web content filtering
- Data loss prevention (DLP)

#### CSP firewall solutions
- Example: Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
#### Policies 
- Example: Azure Policy
- Control cloud resource deployment
- Assess cloud resource compliance
#### Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Prevent data exfiltration
- Example: Azure Information Protection (AIP)

## Cloud Monitoring
#####  Detect abnormalities or suspicious activity (auditing)
##### Who is deploying VMs? 
##### What apps are running? 
##### Log reviews are a type of "detective" security control
##### Centralized log repository
- Log forwarding
