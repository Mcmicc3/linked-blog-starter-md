# Defending a Public Server

# Common Attacks and Mitigations

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
#### Botnets
#### Network/app flooding
#### Low and slow attacks 
#### Mitigation
- Throttling 
- Blackhole routing

## DDoS Attack

## URL Hikacking/ Redirecting
#### Stems from
- User typos that result in redirection to similar URL
- Tainted search results redirect to a malicious site
#### Also called "typosquatting"

## Session Replay Attacks
#### Attacker takes over user session
- Cookie
- URL
- HTML form field
#### Cookie mitigation
- Set HTTPOnly flag
	- Disallows JavaScript cookie access

## Pass-the-Hash Attacks
##### Take advantage of password hashes
##### Attacker compromises system with user login session
##### Attacker uses the hash to gain access to other network resources

## Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)
#### Security as a Service (SECaaS)
#### Cybersecurity outsourcing
- 24x7 remote security monitoring
- Vulnerability assessments
- Pen tests
- Report generation

# Containers and Software-Defined Networking

## Application Containers
#### App components are managed as a single unit
#### Microservices/API
- App component decoupling
#### Can be accessible over the network
- Example: TCP port 80 for a Web site

# Hypervisors and Virtual Machines

## Hypervisors 
#### OS that manages virtual machine guests
#### On-premise hypervisor
- Full configuration control
#### Cloud hypervisors 
- Limited control
#### Type 1
- Bare-metal
- It is the OS
#### Type 2
- Runs as an app within the OS

## Virtual Machines Vulnerabilities
#### Same as host hardening
- Still have to install patches
- Disable unused accounts/services
#### VM sprawl
- Attacker breaks out of VM to hypervisor
