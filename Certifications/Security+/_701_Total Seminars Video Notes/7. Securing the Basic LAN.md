# Data Protection

Only thing that isn't data, are the executable codes for programs.

## Data at rest
- Data on mass storage: HDD, SSD
- No program interacting with data
- Proprietary information

## Data in use / computation
- Software that is running and doing something to the data
- Often unencrypted. Bad guys try to see data while it's in RAM

## Data in transit\
- Data is moving from one system to another
- Sniffing
- Hack and Decrypt the data
- Perform man in the middle attacks

# Cryptographic Methods
How do you send a symmetric key?
## Session Key
- In-Band: Send the key with the encrypted data
	- Not smart
	- Risky
- Out-of-band: Delivering things in person
	- Pointless
###### Symmetric encryption is the primary way we encrypt data

## Ephemeral Key
Temporary
Provides perfect forward secrecy
- A cracked key from 6 months ago is useless today

## Asymmetric Encryption
#### Uses a key pair
- Public Key
- Private Key
###### Public key is only used to encrypt
###### Private key is only used to decrypt
###### Asymmetric encryption is used to send a secure session key
- a little slow

## Cryptosystem
The key is defined, 
Highly defined process that programs can do, to actually make cryptography happen in the real world

# Symmetric Cryptosystems

## Symmetric key algorithm
Any key that is used to encrypt and decrypt

Ex: Word document
#### Block
- Encrypts data in **chunks**
- Symmetric **block** algorithm
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)

## Steps for DES
1.  Initial Permutation
2. Create a sub key
3. Perform a Feistel function
4. Then perform an expansion function
5. Apply S Boxes
6. Perform final permutation
**Incredibly complicated**

## Symmetric Block Algorithms
#### Other types of block encryption
- DES
- Blowfish
- Triple DES (3DES)
Defines by
- Key length
- Block size
- Number of rounds

The larger the block, the faster the encryption
The number of rounds

![[Pasted image 20240714195938.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240714200015.png]]

## Advanced Encryption Standard
![[Pasted image 20240714200239.png]]
The bigger the key size, the bigger the security

### Alternative to block ciphers

## Symmetric Key Cryptosystems
#### Streaming
- Encrypt one bit at a time
- Popular in wireless networking
- **RC4**
- Used to be faster than block cipher
![[Pasted image 20240714200445.png]]

# Symmetric Block Modes
(**Probably not on exam**)

#### Electronic Code Book (ECB)
Running into patterns? By running the same encryption on the same data??
![[Pasted image 20240715161647.png]]
He showed an example where every pixel is encrypted, but we can still figure out what the image is supposed to be

Don't use ECB with symmetric encryption. Instead, use **block modes**
- Encrypt something, and then use that encryption to encrypt something else

#### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
#### Cipher Feedback (CFB)
#### Output Feedback (OF)
#### Counter (CTR)

Supposed to get around the limits of CBC. 
**Nobody uses ECB anymore**

# Asymmetric Cryptosystems

AES requires people to use the same key. Symmetric encryption

### This cryptography uses 2 keys
Generate 2 keys, public key you give to anyone to encrypt. 

## Asymmetric Cryptography
#### RSA uses Factoring
![[Pasted image 20240715162322.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240715164138.png]]


## Authentication
Along with the keys, they would encrypt with the private key, send the encrypted stuff with the public key to prove their identity
This is called a **Digital Signature**

RSA with small keys are crackable
###### Secure RSA uses 4,096 bits minimum
- These are big, create overhead, slow things down

## Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)
![[Pasted image 20240715164536.png]]


# Understanding Digital Certificates
Server sends a client our public key

Two problems: 
1. How do we know the public key actually came from the servers private key?
2.  Is this really the website we think we're on?

One situation where it's not just the private key decrypts and the public key encrypts
- Use private key to encrypt the web page we're sending to the client and hash it, then send the hash along with the public key.
- **Digital Signature**
	- Hash that we send with the public key

But is it really the website we think it is? How do we know who and what is out there?

###### This is when we bring in a 3rd party

Usually you get a signature, you get a key, a hash and a digital signature from a trusted 3rd party

##### This becomes a **Digital Certificate**

##### You can use your own digital signature again for the 3rd party signer to create a **Self Signed Certificate**
- Lets say you have an internal website that only your techs access
- Why do you need a 3rd party signature?

# Trust Models

## Self Signed Certificate
I don't trust anyone, I'm gonna put my signature for me spot on the certificate, and the 3rd party slot
- In a public environment, noone will trust you

There is Web of Trust, and PKI

## Web of trust
Often seen in email
![[Pasted image 20240715170544.png]]
*Lots of people who trust each other*
![[Pasted image 20240715170558.png]]
Used in email, but not popular. Uses lots of responsible on indiviudal people
**Did not take off**

###### It was replaced with PKI

## PKI
Certificate authorities
![[Pasted image 20240715170712.png]]
Everybody knows these companies and trust them.
They get busy, so inbetween the certificate authorites (**CA**), there are Intermediate certificate authorities (**ICA**)
![[Pasted image 20240715170754.png]]

# Public Key Infrastructure

**Not a standard**, It's an idea of how things should be.

## Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

The real certificate authority is often taken offline because of how precious it is, and it's the intermediate certificate authorities that handle everything

Pyramid goes CA at the top, then ICA, but there's a 3rd authority called **Registration authority (RA)**
- Now the ICAs are getting too busy too and now we have RAs to help clients register new certificates

###### This creates a setup called **Certificate Chaining**

# Certificate Types
Talking about the lock icon on browsers
![[Pasted image 20240715171410.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240715171424.png]]
*It tells us what the certificate is for

### All certificates are based on X.509 standard

Comodo is a website that issues certificates.
![[Pasted image 20240715173539.png]]
They create Domain Validation (DV) certificates

## Domain Validation Certificates
Most basic.
We ask for a certificate and it will make one. 
**Only good for one domain**

## Wildcard certificates
All the different variations of a website are registered
- Not the best option, hackers can spoof a bad website using your domain name

## Extended Validation (EV) certificate
Goes through a lot of work
Looking addresses, querying the website to check for websites, get a phone call.
More expensive, but comodo will insure their websites, and if you get hacked there is protection offered.
**Getting an EV certificate is a big deal and gives you more confidence when browsing websites**

## Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificate
Alternative option
It's like a wildcard but more limited.
- www.totelsem.com
- This is a great server.com
- However many you add
Also popular with emails

###### There are more certificates, but these are on the exam

## E-mail certificates
Not as popular as they used to be.
Outlook email address, you can ask comodo to send you an email client to send encrypted emails. 
You can have someone send you a signed email with a certificate on the bottom. Now you have their public key and you can send encrypted emails. 

People used to encrypt email servers. Why do that when you can just encrypt point to point and not have to worry about other people encrypting their servers

## Code-Signing certificate
Certificates for Executable programs. Windows does this.  Microsoft will go to whoever writes the software to verify them, and then create a certificate for them
![[Pasted image 20240715184159.png]]

Hardware also does this
###### Machine/Computer/Hardware certificate
We're going to look at a device driver. Where looking for files with the SAT extension. They're known as catalog files
![[Pasted image 20240715184722.png]]
Checking the properties allows us to see the certificate
![[Pasted image 20240715184738.png]]
##### User certificates
##### Wireless network certificates
- You can put certificates on the access point
- Along with devices on the network
- PAIN

**Get a certificate based on what you're doing**

You might import certificates, enable a feature. 

# Touring Certificates 

Microsoft Managment Console allows us to view certificates
![[Pasted image 20240715184947.png]]
This opens certificate manager
- Other people
- IAC
- Trusted root
- Untrested publishers
![[Pasted image 20240715185016.png]]
We're now looking at the certifiacete

- Who it's by
- When it was issued
- If we look at the details we can see this info
![[Pasted image 20240715185057.png]]
- We can look at the signature algorithm along with the Hash
![[Pasted image 20240715185123.png]]
We can look at the thumb print as a serial number for this certificate. We can revoke certificates using this info
![[Pasted image 20240715185157.png]]
All of this helps us confirm that it's a valid certificate. Check if its valid or revoked

You can add or export certificates
Deleting or uninstalling allows us to remove certificates we no longer need.

## Personal certificates
Can be used as an ID card 

## Trusted root CAs
- You normally download this when updating windows versions
- Sometimes you have to download the certificates yourself when setting up VPN connections

Sometimes we have to share our personal certificate
In certificate manager you can export. Choose the format you want to export in. Is it a Windows system? Linux?

Our system will download the needed systems during system updates

If we setup coorporaate VPNs, we have to setup the certifactes ourselves.
Having the certificates on our systems speeds up the process of getting on the internet.
It's essential that we occasionally check up on our certificates and make sure they're from trusted sources.

# Network Architecture Planning

## Network Architecture
Requires resilience and recovery
Achieved through capacity planning for:
- People
- Technology
- Infrastructure

## People
Plan for the right personnel with the appropriate skills
Have backup personnel to avoid to a single point of failure

## Technology
Plan for the necessary tools and resources to be available
Ensure scalability, recovery, and redundancy
Automation helps with quick responses to security events.

## Infrastructure
Ensures the physical and virtual facilities are robust, agile, and secure
Use multi-cloud solutions to avoid single points of failure and take advantage of competitive pricing and services


# The OSI Model

![[Pasted image 20240715211714.png]]

preamble warns that there's in an incoming frame. 

ethernet frames for layers 1 - 2
ethernet packets for layers 3 - 

session makes the actual connection between remote hosts. This is where port numbers are handled

# ARP Cache Poisoning

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
ARP traffic is local to the LAN

*Breaking down a packet header*
![[Pasted image 20240715212313.png]]

Ethernet 2 header links to Layer 2. Hardware addresses for a network interface. Used for LAN.
Arp Header..shouldn't come with an IP header because it's only on the LAN

Common windows command: arp

`arp  -a` shows us all the entries in our arp cache 
![[Pasted image 20240715213311.png]]

## ARP Cache Poisoning
A type of man-in-the-middle (MITM)/on-path attack.
Victim traffic is sent through the attacker station.
Attacker can view victim traffic.

*Attacker can send a broadcast asking everyone to update their arp cache. It will contain the IP address of the router, but the mac address of his machine*
![[Pasted image 20240715221240.png]]
*Victim machines will then update their arp tables*
![[Pasted image 20240715221304.png]]
*The attacker then configures routing so that all traffic sent to his PC will be pushed to the router, meaning the clients have no idea what's going on*
![[Pasted image 20240715221349.png]]
**All traffic as now going to the attackers station **

## ARP Cache Poisoning Mitigation
#### Use static ARP cache entries
- Hosts will not accept ARP cache updates

#### Limit access to the network
- Network access control (**NAC**)
- MFA
- Device type

# Other Layer 2 Attacks

## Mac Address Flooding Attack
We sent mac address packets to the switch to overwhelm the switch.
- Overwhelm the switch with lots of different MAC addresses, that way it ends up sending all the traffic through all the switch ports. 
![[Pasted image 20240715221825.png]]

## Broadcast Storm/ Switching Loop
#### Excessive amounts of broadcast traffic on a network
#### Caused by
- Failing equipment
- Redundant network links between switches without Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

![[Pasted image 20240715232325.png]]

## Layer 2 Attack Mitigation
###### MAC address filtering for a network access
######  Static MAC address assignments
######  Disable unused switch ports
######  Broadcast storms/loops
- Enable
	- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
	- Bridge Protocol Data unit (BPDU) guard

# Network Planning

## Network Configuration Management
#### Zero Trust
- Internal networks should be untrusted
- Make sure employees can recognize scams
- Use a network IDS/IPS for internal networks

This guy sold insider threats
![[Pasted image 20240715234232.png]]
- Financial problems, wife problems. He was tempted. 

Trust people to a degree, but from an HR perspective, we want to know what people are going through.......

## Network Configuration Management
#### Network and data flow diagrams
#### Naming conventions
- Servers, routers, switches, etc
#### IP addresses ranges
- Address usage within each range
	- Example: routers are always x.y.z.253
	- Have a standard naming convention

## Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
###### By default, all switch ports are on the same VLAN
###### Switches can be virtually configured into separate VLANs

![[Pasted image 20240716003924.png]]

## Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
###### VLANs can span multiple switches through trunking

## Screened Subnet
###### Also called a demilitarized zone (DMZ)
###### Public services are placed in the DMZ
#### Firewall rules must be configured
- Example: only allow HTTPS from the internet to the DMZ web server

![[Pasted image 20240716004149.png]]

# Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) 2.0

Never trust, always verify.
Trust shouldn't be given based on location or previous interaction.
Imagine asking family to show their ID every time they try to enter another room. 

## Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA 2.0)
#### Separation at every level is key
- Ensures CIA
- Two logical plans: control and data plane

Imagine the control plane as a railroad stations manager. Determines the best path for data to travel
![[Pasted image 20240716004440.png]]
Enforces rules and policies. 
They can include access control, security measures
![[Pasted image 20240716004502.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240716004511.png]]

## Control Plane
#### Sets guidelines for how network data is treated
- Prioritizes types of data
- Directs data to specific paths
#### Threat scope reduction
- Minimizing attack areas

## Implementing Zero Trust on the Control Plane
#### Adaptive Identity
- Next-level MFA that includes various factors like time of day, device used, etc.
- Like having a smart lock that can recognize who is at the door, and adjust based on various factors
#### Threat scope reduction
- Minimizing attack areas

#### Policy-driven access control
- Having rules like who can go into a room and when
- Access based on policies, rules, and roles

#### Secured zones
- Segmenting and securing based on data sensitivity
- garage might require pin code, while safe would need a fingerprint

## Data Plane
###### Moves data to its final destination
###### Sometimes called the "forwarding plane"
###### Processes and transmits data packets

## Implementing Zero Trust on the Data Plane
###### No data packet should be trusted just because it's in the network
###### Continually validates and secures data

## Museum example....
**Policy engine**
They make rules about who can do what
![[Pasted image 20240716005303.png]]
- Dictate who can handle what
- What time and for how long

**Policy enforcement points**
![[Pasted image 20240716005352.png]]
- Security guards who enforce the rules....
- They don't allow anyone, just because they were allowed yesterday.
- Constantly check ID for fake or expired users

**Policy automation**
Advanced system like cameras and sensors that detect rule breaking
- If someone gets too close to an artifact, or if something was moved on an hour it wasn't supposed to, everything locks down
![[Pasted image 20240716005626.png]]

## Implementing Zero Trust on the Data Plane
#### Policy Engine
- Sets strict rules, never assumes anyone is harmless
#### Policy enforcement point
- Ensures rules are follow by checking and verifying constantly

#### Policy automation
- Advanced tools to ensure discrepancies are caught and acted upon

Every person and device must regularly identify themselves
# Load Balancing

## Load Balancing(LB)
###### Increases service availability
###### Improves service performance
###### Multiple backend servers provide the same service
- Horizontally auto-scaled
	- Scaling out: add servers
	- Scaling in: remove servers

## Network Load Balancing
Clients connect to a load balancer. DNS address needs to get to the load balancer. 
Client picks the least busiest LB
![[Pasted image 20240716161040.png]]

#### Session persistence
- Clients remain connected to same backend server

## Active/Active Scheduling Methods
#### Round-robin
- Each request goes to the next backend server
#### Least connections
- Each request is sent to the least busy backend server
#### Weighted value
- A relative numeric value assigned to each backend server

## Active/Passive Load Balancing
#### Backend server status
- Active
- Standby state (passive)
###### A standby server is activated when an active server fails


## Server clustering
Linking multiple servers together to act as a cluster 
![[Pasted image 20240716161543.png]]

# Securing Network Access

## Network Access Control (NAC)
#### Limit endpoint access to a network
- Device/OS type
- Device location
- Host-based firewall
- Antivirus/update status
#### Agent/agentless

## IEEE 802.1x
###### Port-based network access control
###### Centralized RADIUS server authentication
###### Wired and wireless network edge devices
- Ethernet switches
- VPN devices
- Wi-Fi routers

## DHCP Snooping Mitigation
#### Block rogue DHCP servers
- Untrusted DHCP server responses are blocked
#### Enabled on network switches
- Specify trusted DHCP ports

## Jump Server
We don't want out backend servers to have Public IP visibility

A **jumpbox** has a public interface for me to interact with, and once I have access, I can communicate with my private network through private interface on the jumpbox
- Acts as a launch pad to get into the private network and protect their identity
![[Pasted image 20240716162627.png]]

# Honeypots

## Decoy Environments
#### Attract and track attackers with fake vulnerable items
#### Be careful
- Use only on an isolated network
- Consider fake attacker-provided telemetry
	- Use centralized logging
#### Honeyfile
- Fake file(s) made to look attractive to attackers
	- Example: "Executive_salaries.xls"
#### Honeynet
- Network of honeypots
#### Honeypot
- Host/device made to look attractive and vulnerable
	- Windows, Linux, macOS, PLC, router, switch, etc.

Then use **Event Viewer** to see the failed login attempts of the honeypot

# Static and Dynamic Code Analysis

## Static Code Analysis
###### Analyzing code without executing it
###### Find vulnerabilities or errors in the source code, configuration files, or system scripts


## Dynamic Code Analysis
###### Examines code while it's running
###### Find memory leaks, unauthorized access attempts, etc.


## Dynamic Code Analysis Tools

#### OWASP Zap (ZED Attack Proxy)
- Pen testing tool used to find web app vulnerabilities during runtime
#### Burp Suite
- Tests web app security by analyzing web traffic during runtime

## Sandboxes
Analyze public websites and software for malicious code and viruses
#### Public Sandbox websites:
- Any.run
- Joe's sandbox
- Virus Total

Sandbox employ static and dynamic scans

*Test sketchy websites*
![[Pasted image 20240716185215.png]]

*You can compare hashes against Any runs database, and it will compare it for malicious code*
![[Pasted image 20240716185304.png]]

*Good to use more than one sandbox. Hybrid analysis is just another option for checking files, URLS, or do searches on domains to see if they're bad*
![[Pasted image 20240716185351.png]]

**Helps you choose which kind of scan you want to do on which *OS*
![[Pasted image 20240716185412.png]]


# Firewalls

## Firewalls
Hardware appliance
VM
Host-based

#### Allow/deny incoming/outgoing traffic
- Access Control Lists (ACL) rules
	- IPV4 and IPV6

## Packet Filtering Firewall
#### OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
#### Stateful firewalls track entire sessions instead of only individual packets
- UDP doesn't use sessions
- TCP uses sessions

#### Rules can be based on
- Source/destination port numbers
- Source/destination IP addresses
- MAC addresses
- Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

*Creating network security groups in Azure
![[Pasted image 20240716190035.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240716190203.png]]

## Content/URL Filtering Firewall
#### OSI layer 7 (Application)
#### Rules can be based on
- Direction of traffic (incoming or outgoing)
- Packet filtering firewall conditions
- Protocol-specific items
	- HTTP method used
	- URL
	- Data in the packet payload

![[Pasted image 20240716201050.png]]

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)
#### OSI Layer 7 (Application)
#### Protects against web app attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cryptographic downgrades
- Directory traversal
- SQL injection

# Proxy Servers

## Forward Proxying

Sits between the internet users, and the internal clients
![[Pasted image 20240716203240.png]]
- Clients communicate with forward proxy
- forward proxy then communicates with internal lan and sends back the information to the requesting clients
- **Protects internal clients**

#### User device uses proxy as default gateway
- "Transparent proxy", no additional software needed
#### Fetched content can be cached
- Speeds up subsequent requests
