# Incident Response Overview

# Incident Response Plans (IRPs) 
## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
#### Suspicious occurrence that raises a red flag
#### Examples: 
- Excessive outbound traffic to a single unknown host
- Newly detected Linux device on a Windows network
- Log/IDS/IPS alerts

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)
#### Proactive preparation for reacting to an attack
- Step-by-step procedures
- Documents
#### Response to threats
- Detection
- Containment
- Eradication
#### Contact list
#### When to escalate

## IRP Testing
#### Designed to detect, contain, and eradicate threats
#### Walkthroughs
#### Simulations
#### Tabletop exercises


# IRP Testing

## IRP Resilience Testing
#### Table-top exercises
#### Fail-over testing
#### Simulations
#### Parallel processing
#### Alert tuning

## Table-Top Exercises
#### Company's key players mentally walk through potential disaster scenarios
#### Discuss actions, decisions, and communication pathways

## Fail-Over Tests
#### Systems are switched from primary to backup or standby modes
#### Helps measure how smooth the transition happens
#### Validates backup mechanisms

## Simulations
#### Mimics potential cyber attacks or failures
#### Helps teams practice their response strategies and skills and evaluate their tools and procedures

## Parallel Processing
#### Running systems concurrently to ensure uninterrupted service
#### If components fail, there's a backup already running
#### Mitigates risk of single-point-of-failure

## Alert Tuning
#### Validates expectations in monitoring solutions
#### Helps identify false outcomes and distinguish between
- False-positive
- False-negative
- True-positive
- True-negative

## False-Positive
#### System falsely indicates that there is a problem
## False-Negative
#### System reports everything is fine when there actually is a problem
## True-Positive 
#### The event being alerted on is actually happening
## True-Negative
#### No event is being reported, and there is no issue


# Threat Analysis and Mitigating Actions

## Cyber Kill Chain Analysis

#### Trace steps taken for a successful compromise/data exfiltration event
#### Security compromise knowledge can help prevent future breaches

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
#### Used for post-compromise identification and anaylsis
- Threat detection
- What was done and how was it done?
#### Identify attacker techniques 
#### Mitigation
- Modify existing firewall, IDS/IPS alert rules
- Deploy honeypot traps

## The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis 
#### Shows how malicious actors (adversaries) use exploit capabilities over an infrastructure against victims
#### Data can stem from the use of honeypots

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
#### Automate incident response using playbooks
- Firewall rules, content filters
- Application allow/deny lists
- Revoke certificates
#### Reduce incident response time

# Digital Forensics

## Digital Forensics
Legal hold
Chain of custody
Acquisition
Reporting
E-discovery
Preservation

## Legal Hold
#### Ensures no data or digital evidence is deleted or altered

## Digital Chain of Custody
#### Documented timeline record of who handled the digital evidence

#### Ensures integrity and authenticity of the evidence

## Acquisition
#### Collecting digital data without altering it

## Reporting
#### Analyzing the digital data and creating a report containing:
- Findings
- Actions taken
- Any other relevant information

## E-Discovery
#### Finding, collecting, and delivering electronic information relevant for use in legal cases

## Preservation
#### Ensuring the evidence remains safe, intact, and unchanged
#### Make backups and store them safely

## Steganography
#### Concealing information within seemingly unsuspicious data
#### Criminals can try and hide data in other messages, videos, or images

# Business Continuity and Alternate Sites
## Planning for Disasters
#### Business continuity plan (BCP)
- Continuity of operations (COOP)
- Broad scope
#### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
- Narrow scope such as specific server
#### Organizational policies
- Change management
- Asset management
- Security

## Disaster Recovery Sites
#### Site risk assessment
- Geographical location
#### Site components
- Hardware
- Software 
- Data 
- Personnel
#### The public cloud is often used as an alternate site

## Hot Site
#### Hardware
#### Software
#### Networking in place
#### Up-to-date data 
- Continuous replication with primary site
#### Personnel
#### Quickest switchover time, most expensive

## Warm Site
#### Hardware
#### Software
#### Networking in place
#### No up-to-date data
#### Longer switchover time than hot, less expensive than hot
#### Personnel may be present

## Cold Site
#### Basic IT infrastructure in place
- Networking
#### No hardware
#### No software
#### No data
#### No personnel
#### Longest switchover time, cheapest type of recovery site


# Data Backup

## Data Backup Considerations
#### On-premises
- Tape
- Networking attached storage (NAS)
- Storage area network (SAN)
#### Offsite
- Cloud
#### Compression
#### Encryption
#### Type of backup
#### Virtual machine
- Snapshots
- Custom images

## Full/Copy Backup
#### All data is backed up
- Longest time for backup
- Shortest time for restore
#### Example:
- Weekly full backup

## Incremental Backup
#### New/modified data since the last incremental backup
- Shortest time to backup 
- Longest time to restore
#### Example:
- Full backup weekly, incremental nightly

## Differential Backup
#### New/modified data since last full backup
- Longer to backup than incremental, shorter than full
- Quicker to restore than incremental, slower than full
