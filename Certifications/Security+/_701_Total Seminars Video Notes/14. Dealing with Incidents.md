# Incident Response Overview

# Incident Response Plans (IRPs) 
## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
#### Suspicious occurrence that raises a red flag
#### Examples: 
- Excessive outbound traffic to a single unknown host
- Newly detected Linux device on a Windows network
- Log/IDS/IPS alerts

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)
#### Proactive preparation for reacting to an attack
- Step-by-step procedures
- Documents
#### Response to threats
- Detection
- Containment
- Eradication
#### Contact list
#### When to escalate

## IRP Testing
#### Designed to detect, contain, and eradicate threats
#### Walkthroughs
#### Simulations
#### Tabletop exercises


# IRP Testing

## IRP Resilience Testing
#### Table-top exercises
#### Fail-over testing
#### Simulations
#### Parallel processing
#### Alert tuning

## Table-Top Exercises
#### Company's key players mentally walk through potential disaster scenarios
#### Discuss actions, decisions, and communication pathways

## Fail-Over Tests
#### Systems are switched from primary to backup or standby modes
#### Helps measure how smooth the transition happens
#### Validates backup mechanisms

## Simulations
#### Mimics potential cyber attacks or failures
#### Helps teams practice their response strategies and skills and evaluate their tools and procedures

## Parallel Processing
#### Running systems concurrently to ensure uninterrupted service
#### If components fail, there's a backup already running
#### Mitigates risk of single-point-of-failure

## Alert Tuning
#### Validates expectations in monitoring solutions
#### Helps identify false outcomes and distinguish between
- False-positive
- False-negative
- True-positive
- True-negative

## False-Positive
#### System falsely indicates that there is a problem
## False-Negative
#### System reports everything is fine when there actually is a problem
## True-Positive 
#### The event being alerted on is actually happening
## True-Negative
#### No event is being reported, and there is no issue
