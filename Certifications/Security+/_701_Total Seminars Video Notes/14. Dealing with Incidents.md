# Incident Response Overview

If we get hacked, if a router goes down, we handle it with incident response

setup teams, do we have to bring in legal, or PR?

Digital forensics
- Get into the PC and find evidence to prove it was someone

Continuity of operations
- Hurricane hit the manufacturing facility, how do we keep business going?
- Alternate location

disaster recovery
- Bringing everything back to normal after very bad things happen
- How do we drain the water out of the server rooms and replace everything

# Incident Response Plans (IRPs) 
## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
#### Suspicious occurrence that raises a red flag
#### Examples: 
- Excessive outbound traffic to a single unknown host
- Newly detected Linux device on a Windows network
- Log/IDS/IPS alerts

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)
#### Proactive preparation for reacting to an attack
- Step-by-step procedures
- Documents
#### Response to threats
- Detection
- Containment
- Eradication
#### Contact list
#### When to escalate

## IRP Life Cycle

## IRP Testing
#### Designed to detect, contain, and eradicate threats
#### Walkthroughs
#### Simulations
#### Tabletop exercises

###### Exam Tip 
**Understand incident response lifecycle, and the incident response process involves **

# IRP Testing

## IRP Resilience Testing
#### Table-top exercises
#### Fail-over testing
#### Simulations
#### Parallel processing
#### Alert tuning

## Table-Top Exercises
#### Company's key players mentally walk through potential disaster scenarios
- Create what if scenarios

#### Discuss actions, decisions, and communication pathways
- Prepares teams for the real thing
- Provide a low cost and safe environment to refine response strategies

## Fail-Over Tests
#### Systems are switched from primary to backup or standby modes
- Deliberate transition to the backup systems, to make sure they work
#### Helps measure how smooth the transition happens
#### Validates backup mechanisms
- Allows teams to verify how smooth the transition is and practice their response
- No risk 

## Simulations
#### Mimics potential cyber attacks or failures
#### Helps teams practice their response strategies and skills and evaluate their tools and procedures

## Parallel Processing
#### Running systems concurrently to ensure uninterrupted service
- Systems run concurrently, sharing tasks
#### If components fail, there's a backup already running
#### Mitigates risk of single-point-of-failure

## Alert Tuning
#### Validates expectations in monitoring solutions
#### Helps identify false outcomes and distinguish between
- False-positive
- False-negative
- True-positive
- True-negative

## False-Positive
#### System falsely indicates that there is a problem
## False-Negative
#### System reports everything is fine when there actually is a problem
## True-Positive 
#### The event being alerted on is actually happening
## True-Negative
#### No event is being reported, and there is no issue

Resilience and recovery testing, ensure that organizations are prepared for organizational challenges, and are equipped to respond.

Tools and methods in IRP testing act as drills and performance boosters 

# Threat Analysis and Mitigating Actions

## Cyber Kill Chain Analysis

#### Trace steps taken for a successful compromise/data exfiltration event
#### Security compromise knowledge can help prevent future breaches
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721132806.png]]
1. Reconnaissance
	1. Gather info on potential targets
2. Intrusion
	##### 1. Can involve scanning (Vulnerabilities, network, etc)
3. Exploitation
	1. Exploiting a vulnerability
4. Privilege escalation
	1. Once a host is compromised, they will seek the most powerful account
5. Lateral Movement
	1. Scower the network. See what they can break into
6. Obfuscation/anti-forensics
	1. Covering their tracks
	2. Clearing log files, planting files in machines to maintain persistent access, but making it look benign
7. Denial of service (DoS)
8. Exfiltration
	1. Stealing data

Not every incident will follow everything in this list.
We're trying to figure out how someone stole data

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
Identify the tactics that an attacker used to get into a system

#### Used for post-compromise identification and analysis
- Threat detection
- What was done and how was it done?
#### Identify attacker techniques 
#### Mitigation
- Modify existing firewall, IDS/IPS alert rules
	- Maybe an alert didn't get to the right person in time?
- Deploy honeypot traps

## The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis 
#### Shows how malicious actors (adversaries) use exploit capabilities over an infrastructure against victims
#### Data can stem from the use of honeypots
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721133152.png]]
- Adversary - Victim
- Capabilities - Infrastructure
## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

A way to automate incident response by creating scripts, and a workflow (decision making)
- If this happens, do this
- If that happens, do that

#### Automate incident response using playbooks
- Firewall rules, content filters
- Application allow/deny lists
- Revoke certificates
#### Reduce incident response time
- **Ultimate goal**

##### Exam Tip
I might be asked to used an incident response model for something after it has already occurred, not before. 
- Some of these models are just to prepare ahead of time

# Digital Forensics

## Digital Forensics

Legal hold
Chain of custody
Acquisition
Reporting
E-discovery
Preservation

## Legal Hold
#### Ensures no data or digital evidence is deleted or altered
- Police tape off the area, so nobody can get in and tamper with the evidence

## Digital Chain of Custody
#### Documented timeline record of who handled the digital evidence

#### Ensures integrity and authenticity of the evidence

Every time evidence is found, who found it is recorder, along with where and when. Then it's securely stored. Also recorded when it gets handed off to another person

## Acquisition
#### Collecting digital data without altering it

Tools and methods are used to make an exact copy of the data for an investigation
- Data can't be tampered with

## Reporting
#### Analyzing the digital data and creating a report containing:
- Findings
- Actions taken
- Any other relevant information

After collecting all data and clues, a detailed report is written, including potential suspects

## E-Discovery
#### Finding, collecting, and delivering electronic information relevant for use in legal cases

Sifting through the digital evidence room, and finding the necessary pieces of evidence

## Preservation
#### Ensuring the evidence remains safe, intact, and unchanged
#### Make backups and store them safely

Collected evidence is secured in a safe, or a secure room

## Steganography
#### Concealing information within seemingly unsuspicious data
- Hiding data
#### Criminals can try and hide data in other messages, videos, or images

Cryptography changes plain text to cypher text. 
Steganography attempts to hide data in plain site.

# Business Continuity and Alternate Sites
## Planning for Disasters
#### Business continuity plan (BCP)
- Continuity of operations (COOP)
- Broad scope
#### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
- Narrow scope such as specific server
	- DRP for different systems
#### Organizational policies
- Change management
- Asset management
- Security
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240721134956.png]]

## Disaster Recovery Sites
#### Site risk assessment
- Geographical location
#### Site components
- Hardware
- Software 
- Data 
- Personnel
#### The public cloud is often used as an alternate site

## Hot Site
#### Hardware
#### Software
#### Networking in place
#### Up-to-date data 
- Continuous replication with primary site
#### Personnel
#### Quickest switchover time, most expensive

## Warm Site
#### Hardware
#### Software
#### Networking in place
#### No up-to-date data
- It would take time to get the data in place to continue business operations
#### Longer switchover time than hot, less expensive than hot
#### Personnel may be present

## Cold Site
#### Basic IT infrastructure in place
- Networking
#### No hardware
#### No software
#### No data
#### No personnel
#### Longest switchover time, cheapest type of recovery site

##### Exam tip
Expect a question on planning for it, or which site is best

# Data Backup

## Data Backup Considerations
Backups increase availability

#### On-premises
- Tape
- Networking attached storage (NAS)
- Storage area network (SAN)
#### Offsite
- Cloud


#### Compression
#### Encryption
#### Type of backup
#### Virtual machine
- Snapshots
- Custom images

## Full/Copy Backup
#### All data is backed up
- Longest time for backup
- Shortest time for restore
#### Example:
- Weekly full backup

## Incremental Backup
#### New/modified data since the last incremental backup
- Shortest time to backup 
- Longest time to restore
#### Example:
- Full backup weekly, incremental nightly

## Differential Backup
#### New/modified data since last full backup
- Longer to backup than incremental, shorter than full
- Quicker to restore than incremental, slower than full
