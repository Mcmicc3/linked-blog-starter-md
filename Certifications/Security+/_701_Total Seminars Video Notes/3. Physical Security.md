# Physical Security Overview

Passive vs active defense
- Fences vs guards
# Physical Security

## Physical Security
#### IT services rely on underlying hardware
- On-premises
- Cloud
#### Local access to IT systems is a security risk
- Encrypt data at rest

Brought up a hardware keylogger
**Keep in mind that password managers protect from keyloggers**

## Personnel
Guards
Badges
Visitor Logs
Robot Sentries
Reception

## Facility Security
#### Location
- Undisclosed address
- Protection from natural disasters
#### Signage
#### Fencing
- Height
- Periodic inspection

#### Barricades/Bollards
#### Industrial camouflage
#### Motion detection
- Lighting
- Alarm systems

Server room security

#### Air gapping
- No phsycial connection from one network to another
- No access from the outside
- Hackers want to somehow get something on the network.

# Environmental Controls

## Server Room Airflow Management

Keep incoming cool air separated from outgoing warmer air
Draw in cool air to equipment
Draw hot air from equipment out

#### Containment panels/curtains
- prevent cool and warm air from mixing
#### Blanking panels
- Fill empty rack slots to optimize airflow

When digital equipment's overheat, the server will throttle the CPU, slowing down the CPU. 
- This could set off Intrusion detection alarms creating false alarms
- Systems might shut down, causing us to lose money

## Environmental Monitoring
#### Sensors
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Noise
- Proximity

#### Monitoring software
# Physical Security Lab

Take a few minutes to survey your home/work environment for possible security concerns.

How could a malicious hacker get on my network? Or steal devices containing sensitive data?


## Physical Security Concerns
- Computer left unattended (even if locked)
	- Hardware keyloggers
- Computer left logged in
- Unlocked doors and windows
- Access to a server room or wiring closet/oanel
- Workstations near windows
- Unencrypted storage media
- USB ports on computers that are not disabled
