*Diffusion*

- Images look fuzzier
- Less visible, but you can still make it up

*Confusion*

Caesar Cipher

ROT2, ROT3

Cryptanalysis

Viginere Cipher
![[Pasted image 20240724133100.png]]
- All the possible ROT ciphers
*Included a Key*

Need algorithms for binary data

Exclusive Or (XOR)
![[Pasted image 20240724133425.png]]
- Converted to binary

Kerckhoffs principle 

# Hashing

Message digest

MD5 (Message Digest 5)
- Old
- Uses 128 bit hash
- Had issues

SHA (Family of hashes)

Earliest verison is SHA1

#### Collisions
![[Pasted image 20240724134513.png]]
- Collisions occur when two different pieces of data generate the same hash

**SHA-1 and MD5 shouldn't be used anymore**

Now we use SHA-256 or SHA-512

RIPEMD
- Not common
- Open standard
- Not used often

Your hash is used to log in

# Cryptographic Attacks

Cryptanalysis

## Attack the Algorithm

Only way to attack an algorithm successfully is to trick someone into using a weaker encryption
## Attack the Implementation
TLS

Cryptosystems, weak spots
- WEP
	- Used RC4 and the keys were short
	- RC4 wasn't the problem, the implementation is
## Attack the Key
If we can figure out the key, we have an inside line...
Most systems, passwords get transformed into a key

# Password Cracking

Where do passwords get stored on systems?
Password morphs into keys

There is a place on Linux systems that has usernames and hashes
![[Pasted image 20240724135253.png]]
Hashes get compared and if they match, you get authenticated

Problem:
People

Brute force
- How long are the passwords

Dictionary attack
- Starts with a dictionary text file
- Rockyou.txt
- Can't compare both passwords and hashes


Rainbow table
- Uses reduction functions to make it easire to search
- We can make tables with passwords and associate hashes

offline attack
- Take the hash, use tools off the network to compare the hash

salting
- Anybody can see the salt?

![[Pasted image 20240724135711.png]]

Key stretching
- Similar to salting
- PBKDF2
- WPA encryption, you set a shared key for a ssid, but built into 802.11 is a key stretching function
	- Password + SSID + 5 Salts
