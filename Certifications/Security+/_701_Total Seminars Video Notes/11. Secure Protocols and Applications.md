# DNS Security

## Common Secure Protocols
#### DNS
- TCP/UDP port 53
- Domain Hijacking
	- Other people grab our domain if we don't update it quickly enough
- URL redirection
	- Hack into DNS server and redirect traffic
- Cache poisoning
	- All DNS servers keep a cache of FQDN
	- Inject fake cache and make people show up where I want
- Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
	- All DNS zones have certificates
#### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- UDP port 161/162
- Version 1,2,3

## Common Secure Protocols
#### Secure Shell (SSH)
- TCP 22
#### Secured File Transfer Protocol/FTP over SSL (FTPS)
- TCP port 990
#### SSH FTP (SFTP)
- TCP port 22
#### Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
- UDP port 5004

# Secure Web and E-mail


## Securing Web Apps
#### Can be accessible internally or externally
#### Hide true web server IP address
- Load balancing
	- People connect to the load balancers IP, not the direct IP of the server in the back
- Reverse proxying 
	- Multiple servers published onto the internet, with public IPs and port numbers that get translated onto an internal IP and port
	- Applies up to layer 7
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
	- Same but applies up to layer 4 

#### HTTPS
- Enabled on the web server 
- Requires a server PKI certificate
	- Issued to the HTTPS server to cerate an HTTPS binding
- Uses TCP port 443 instead of 80
- TLS
	- Uses version 1.2 or higher

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240719003503.png]]
*IIS is the config tool used to ensure we use TLS Version 1.2 or higher*

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240719003522.png]]
*Creating HTTPS Binding. We can change the default IP if we want to.*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240719003540.png]]
*We might have to get a certificate from a publicly trusted  CA*

## Web App User Authentication

#### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over SSL (LDAPS)
- Directory service access protocol
- Supported by Microsoft Active Directory
	- Application configuration information, groups. LDAPS is similar
- Requires a server PKI certificate
	- Needs to be configured to the host and issued
- Uses TCP port 636 instead of 389
#### On-premises and cloud

## Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 
#### Domain reputation
- Determines if mail will be received by other SMTP hosts
	- *Subscribes to feeds to now not to receive email from spamming domains*
#### Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
- Encrypt and sign e-mail messages
- Requires a client PKI certificate
	- Needed to encrypt email

## E-Mail Protocols 
#### SMTP
- E-mail transfer protocol
#### Post Office Protocol (POP)
- Client e-mail retrieval protocol
#### Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
- Client e-mail retrieval protocol
- More capabilities like synchronizing some folders instead of all messages
#### Each can be secured with a server PKI certificate


# Request Forgery Attacks

## Request Forgeries
#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Targets users and unchanging session tokens
	- Your browser is given a cookie to uniquely identify your session to interact with a secure site until it's timed out. When it does you get a new token. *If a hacker hijacks our webbrowser, they have access to our cookies, meaning they have an authenticated session with a secure site, like a bank. Users don't know it's happening*
- Designed to hijack authenticated sessions between a client and a server

#### Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Targets web servers
	- **Same thing but happens on the server side. They can make this server request other servers. They can steal information from the backend through the frontend**
- Designed to have server make HTTP requests to other services
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240719004622.png]]

## Request Forgeries

#### Mitigation
- Harden client devices
- Use web application firewall (WAF)

# Cross-Site Scripting Attacks

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack

#### Starts with a web app that doesn't properly validate or sanitize input
- All user input must be untrusted
#### Attacker injects malicious code into vulnerable website
- JavaScript is commonly used

#### Website visitors unknowingly execute malicious code

# Web Application Security

## Web App Security

##### For web server admins and web app developers
##### Harden public-facing and private web apps

## Injection Attacks
#### Malicious user input is accepted by the web app
#### Types
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- Extensible Markup Language (XML)
#### Mitigation
- Sanitize all user input

## Secure Coding
#### Software development security best practices
- Input validation
- Secure web browser cookies
	- Requiring strict HTTPS connectivity
- HTTP headers
	- Shouldn't allow post or put methods if it's read only 
- Code signing
	- Software developers digitally sign their code
- Use trusted components and APIs

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240719005546.png]]

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
##### Automate developer code changes
##### Test for quality assurance
##### Send update notifications to users for code version control
##### Security issues
- Attackers could make changes and inject into the update

## Infrastructure As Code
##### VM templates
- Automate VMs on site or on the cloud
##### Cloud templates
- Automate the deployment of cloud for rapid and consistent provisioning
- An attacker can configure an account for backdoor access
#### Rapid and consistent provisioning/ deprovisioning
- Useful for sandbox testing
#### Security issues
- Attackers could modify templates

## Software Testing
#### Static testing
- Code review
- Manually scanning code
#### Dynamic testing
- Observe runtime behavior 
- App is up and running and we're testing it for security
#### Fuzzing 
- Provide app with unexpected data
- Identity weaknesses and then harden them

# OWASP Top 10
Isn't updated annually
Only updated based on the evolving threat landscape
- Roughly every 3 or 5 years

OWASP.org shows the Top 10 current application risks

*They show us a list of which attacks have become more popular, and which are less popular*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240722220056.png]]

1. Broken access control
	1. Unauthorized actions within an app
	2. *Bouncer letting in the wrong crowd*
2. Cryptographic failures
	1. *Leaving sensitive info open on a computer while you're away*
	2. Some apps accidentally expose sensitive information
3. Injection
	1. *It's look using your car key to open your front door, and it works*
	2. Hackers send malicious data to an app, without having permission to do so. Pretty much XSS
4. Insecure Design
	1. Intentionally creating back doors in your code
	2. Not testing your code thoroughly enough and testing for vulnerabilities
	3. Not considering business risks when designing a program
5. Security Misconfiguration
	1. Exposed error messages
	2. Accidental services accessed
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
	1. Attackers exploit weak spots
	2. If the components are too out of date, you might need to consider replacing it
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
	1. *Like dressing up as a security guard with a fake badge*
	2. Look the part, but not authorized. Apps can be tricked.
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
	1. Assumptions can lead to vulnerabilities in the code
	2. Insecure deserialization
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
	1. Alarm bells can be ignored
10. Server-side Requests Forgery (SSRF)
	1. Attacker crafts a URL request that doesn't validate the code from the client

The OWASP website explains what the vulnerability is, how it's exploited, and how to fix it. 

# Web App Vulnerability Scanning

OWASP ZAP (*Zed Attack Proxy*) project tool
- To run an analysis against a web app, you need to sit in the  middle of a request being sent to the web to monitor the request and the response
- You can also scan the web app for vulnerabilities
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240723162728.png]]

*Give IP or name of the website you want it to attack, then hit the attack button*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240723162937.png]]
*Click on Alerts to see what it found*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240723163010.png]]
*We can get explanations for what the alerts mean*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240723163027.png]]
*We don't want to allow file and directory browsing, that would be a directory traversal attack*

*Private IP addresses being disclosed*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240723163159.png]]
*Often times, we didn't create the web page, so we take a snapshot of the code and show the web developers*
