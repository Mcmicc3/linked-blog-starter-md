Each represents a possible weak point.

Partners weak point can affect everyone.

Contractors operate on the edges of a organizations security focus
- They often don't get training as often as we do
Backdoors in clouds can lead to issues for us

## Due Diligence
#### Rigorous research and analysis of a third-party 
#### Ensures they uphold security standards

It's not about the best price

## Conflict of Interest
#### When personal interests compromise business decisions 

A persons personnel internet can compromise the integrity of our security

## Questionnaries

# Attestation

Process of verifying certain attributes or claims of system device, or an individual may have.

## System-Based Attestation
#### Validates a system or component to ensure its authenticity and integrity against a security standard 
#### Example: TPM chip

Checks integrity of firmware, OS, and components. If anything doesn't check out, the boot will load in a restricted mode

## Identity-Based Attestation
#### Validation based on a set of identity attributes
#### Example: Validating credentials using MFA

Only when the MFA is verified, is the users identity attested to, so they can have access. 

## Legal-Based Attestation
#### Formal agreement under the law to confirm accuracy of facts, events, etc.
#### Example: Employee signs an Acceptable Use Policy and promises to use the IT resources appropriately

Legal document that you sign to confirm that you aren't going to do what you can't do. I have read, understood, and agreed to abide by the policy. 

*Confirm and verify claims through evidence or proof.*
*Attestation is all about providing proof or evidence to establish trust*

- Quality assurance
- *Often used in industry like robot equipment needs to be recalibrated*


## Supply Chain Security Risks
#### Hardware and software vendors
- End-of-service life (EOL, EOSL) means no more patches or support
- *Usually there's not enough budget or time to scourer for EOL software*
#### Cloud service providers security compliance
- A lot of people think it's safer to secure a cloud on your own systems
- Public cloud providers have a lot to lose if their services aren't trusted
*Compliance monitoring can be automated through cloud platforms like AWS*

# Change Management

## Change Management Considerations
##### Approval of ownership
##### Stakeholders
##### Impact analysis
##### Test results
##### Backout plans
##### Maintenance windows
##### Standard operating procedures

## Approval of Ownership
#### Formal authorization confirming a proposed change aligns with security needs of the asset of system in question
#### Identifies who is responsible for the change

*Whoever owns the change understands the security implications while guaranteeing the proper precautions are taken*
## Stakeholders
#### Have an invested interest in the change
#### Ensures different perspectives are considered, especially for overall organizational goals

## Impact Analysis
#### Assess how the change will affect various parts of the organization

#### Evaluate risk and benefits

## Test Results
#### Information gathered from the testing change in a controlled environment
#### Reveals how the change behaves and the impact on security

Allowing for adjustments before full implementation

## Backout Plans
#### Strategies for reversing a change if something goes wrong

Having a backout plan, ensures that if something goes wrong, we can revert it back to a safe state

## Maintenance Windows
#### Scheduled time frames for when changes are implemented 
#### Usually during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions

Implementing change during maintenance windows help control the environment, minimized risk, and allows for careful monitoring

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
#### Detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to carry out the change
#### Ensure everyone understands their responsibilities, timelines, and execution to minimize mistakes


Change management is all about ensuring that making changes doesn't introduce vulnerabilities or disruptions. 

# Technical Change Management

#### Allow and deny list
Permit or block specific activities, or access to certain resources, for operation integrity and testing.

Vital to update allow and deny list whenever new software and systems are put in place. That way only authorized users can access or alter resources

#### restricted activity
Actions that are limited or controlled within a system to prevent accidental harm or unauthorized access

#### Downtime
Period when a system or service is unavailable often for maintenance or upgrade

planning for downtown will ensure that changes can be made without making unplanned disruption to users
#### service restarts
Planned events for services and software that need to be restarted in order to be upgraded or fixed

Proper execution of these events avoid unexpected disruptions of any critical systems or services

#### Legacy applications
Older software that might not be fully compatible with newer technologies. It's important to consider older applications and make sure they'll still work after updating

#### Dependencies
Relationships between different components where one relies on the other to function.

Changes to one part of the system might also affect another one. Understanding dependencies ensure that everything continues to work smoothly. 

#### Updating documents and diagrams
One thing to depend on is to make sure to have tons of documentation. All of which needs to be updated regularly *especially* when changes are made

Updating datagrams involves keeping visual representations like charts, emergency exit maps or network diagrams up to date. 

If you don't update your diagrams, people might be working with outdated, or incorrect information leading to confusion or mistakes.
#### Updating policies and procedures
When a process or technology cahnges, you need to update the rules and instrusctions, and make sure everyone is aware of the changes. If people follow outdated procedures, it could lead to problems, or even legal issues.

#### version control 
You don't want to mix old plans with new ones. Version control ensures that everyone is working the latest and correct version of the document. Without version control, teammates might be working on outdated information, leading to conflicts or errors.

# What is Automation and Orchestration?

**Scripting** is building out the task list so the computer understands the direction 

**Automation** is simply running the script over and over again

**Orchestration** is combining multiple automations together to create a powerful result

**Orchestrator** is the robot manager that makes sures everything is running correctly


![[Pasted image 20240724083442.png]]

Automation and orchestration is about proactively mitigating risks and responding to threats along with normal operational demand in a swift and efficient manner.
# Benefits of Automation and Orchestration

## Benefits of Automation and Orchestration
#### Efficiency and time savings
- Speeding up many security tasks like scanning for vulnerabilities or creating users accounts or assigning user permissions automatically based on permissions and roles

#### Enforcing baselines
automation ensures that baseline security settings and policies are applied consistently reducing the chances of error or oversight. Catches deviations from known analytics
#### Standard, automated infrastructure configurations
Ensure every server computer or infrastructure device is setup correctly to predefined operational standards. This means fewer vulnerabilities from misconfigurations or human error

#### Secure scaling (elasticity)
Security measures grow with the organization without dropping standards

#### Employee retention
When staff only does repetitive tasks, they get bored and leave. When robots do it, employees can do more engaging and meaningful work

#### Reaction time
The moment an incident occurs, computers have near instant reaction time.  Automated devices can react quicker than people

#### Workforce multiplier
Fewer personnel in a workforce, can manage larger systems, as well as respond to more threats, effectively multiplying the workforces capabilities

**They make things faster, more efficient, and ensure that everything is done correctly, every time. This allows humans to focus on complex task, and innovation**


# Orchestration 

## Use Cases of Automation and Orchestration
#### User and resource provisioning
- User provisioning means enabling and disabling services and access for employee s. Every time a new employee joins the company, they need special access. If an employee is leaving on bad terms, its critical to suspend their access immediately. 

-  Servers and data storage must be scaled up or down.
- If users and resources are provisioned by a human, there is a greater chance for a mistake
- Users can be created by a pre defined template. When an employee leaves, all of their access can be removed quickly
- No more searching around for all the accounts the employee has access to
- You can automatically create templates for each resource to make sure that it's provisioned securely, every time, without a manual check 
- Reduces human error and ensures consistently

#### Guard rails
- Boundaries within a system.
- People sometimes intentionally or accidentally overstep their boundaries
- This can lead to breaches
- Adding DLP, prevents sensitive or proprietary data from being transported outside of the company

#### Security groups
- Created by grouping employees and devices based on their security access needs
- When they're manually setup, incorrect group assignments can be made to expose sensitive data or create unknown risks
- Security groups can be created based on pre defined roles. 
- This can lead to consistent and error free security access

#### Ticket creation and escalation
- Employees need a  quick way to report their concerns, so they can be worked on accordingly
- High risk tickets might not make it to the top of the que
- Automation will tell you which tickets needs to be worked on immediately
- When critical tickets are given priority status, they go to escalation
- These tickets can be setup to automatically setup an alert to the incident response team
- Making sure that high risk tickets are worked on immediately

#### Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- If code isn't closely inspected, it may introduce vulnerabilities, or break legacy apps
- Hackers can exploit bugs to hack into a system and steal information
- It's easy to miss small errors
- Developers use automation to test and scan every line of their code for vulnerabilities, before deployment
- Monitor operations post deployment
- Continuously integrating fixes and patches, and continuously delivering updating code, hence the name

#### Integrations and APIs
- When done manually, the data exchange might be intercepted or mishandled
- This can be automated to enforce security procotols for data exchange, ensuring CIA
- Leads to safe integration between systems


# Other Considerations of Automation and Orchestration

## Other Considerations of Automation
#### Complexity
- Introducing complex automations can make system harder to understand and manage
- If implemented incorrectly, the complexity can lead to hidden vulnerabilities or unintended consequences
- Important to keep detailed and up to date documentation
#### Cost
- Return on investment can be realized through increased deficiency, fewer errors, and reduced manual workload
- Its essential to weigh the initial cost over the long-term benefits

#### Single point of failure
- If the orchestration system crashes, multiple security processes can be halted, leading systems vulnerability
- Critical to have redundancy, backups, and robust monitoring 
#### Technical debt
- In software and automation, taking shortcuts or temporary fixes can lead to bigger problems down the road that cost more time money, and effort to address. 
- As you implement shortcuts, you incur a debt. A future cost to go back and fix these patches
- Can lead to inefficient operations and vulnerabilities, leading to a system that is hard to upgrade or maintain.
#### Ongoing supportability
- As technology evolves, automation tools need updated and patches
- If the devices aren't well supported, or rely on obsolete vendors and modules, it could lead to vulnerabilities
- Essential to choose well established tools.


# Putting It All Together

## Security Awareness, Monitoring, and Reporting
#### 1. Initial reporting and monitoring
#### 2. Development of security awareness practices
#### 3. Execution of security awareness practices
#### 4. Recurring monitoring and reporting

## Initial Reporting and Monitoring
#### Regularly monitor your system with:
- Security incident and Event Management (SIEM) systems
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

**These tools provide real time data. They detect security events and prevent them**
## Develop Security Awareness Practices
#### Starts with risk assessment
#### Proper employee training
- Tailored training programs
- Simulated attacks
- Target social engineering campaigns

**HR people shouldn't be trained to handle incidents like the programming department**

## Execute Security Awareness Practices
#### In-person, virtual, eLearning
#### Make it engaging
#### Regularly update training materials
#### Gather feedback

## Recurring Monitoring and Reporting
#### Set a schedule for reporting on security awareness
#### Monthly or quarterly reports
