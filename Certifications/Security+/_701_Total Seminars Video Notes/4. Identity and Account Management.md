# Identification, Authentication, Authorization

Identification: Username | *Drivers license*
Authentication: password | *Receipt*
Authorization: *What do I get to do?

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
Using more than one factor of authentication
#### Factors (MAIN ONES)
- Something you know | *Password*
- Something you have  | *Smart card, RSA token*
- Something you are | *Face recognition, thumb prints*

Two-factor authentication

## Authentication Attributes
Something you do | *signature*, 
Something you exhibit | *Typing speed*
Something you know |  *Trust* 
Somewhere you are |  *Physical location like getting gas*

**There is a difference between enabled to enforced**
- *We now need to sign into user 1 (the person we enabled MFA)*

![[Pasted image 20240709170608.png]]

Something you know | *password*
Something you have | *Phone, say that we can read the text sent to us with the code*

# Authorization
## Authorization
Based on permissions granted | *User, computer, software*
Determines resources permissions
Can only occur after authentication

#### Resources
- Targets that have permission applied to them
- Example: files, database rows, web app

Track permissions usage for accountability proposes

Who or what accessed which resource, how long, on what date?

*Making sure that a Virtual machine has permission to store on the cloud.*
![[Pasted image 20240709173422.png]]
*Assign an identity to a machine, and then assign permissions to that identity*
- **Managed identity**
![[Pasted image 20240709173535.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240709173622.png]]
*The VM only shows up because we gave it a managed identity*
![[Pasted image 20240709173647.png]]
*Notice that it is now a storage account contributor*

# Accounting

## Accounting
Often called auditing
Track activity
Must have separate user accounts for each user
#### Types of auditing
- Resources access
- Failed logon attempts
- Changes to files/database records

*Event view*
![[Pasted image 20240709174011.png]]
- We can see the source network address
![[Pasted image 20240709175126.png]]

**Jumpbox** goes through a server with a public IP, that then connects to a server with a private IP 
- That way your server isn't directly exposed on the internet
# Authentication Methods

## Authentication Methods
#### Password vaults
- Also called "password managers"
- Examples: LastPass, cloud-based vaults to store password keys
- A master key protects the vault
	-Don't forget it!

*Credential Manager*
![[Pasted image 20240709175723.png]]
- Guy says it's a bad idea to store here, if someone hacks this PC, they have access to all your passwords
- Windows level credential manager depends on how strong your windows security is
![[Pasted image 20240709175827.png]]

## One-Time Password (OTP)

#### Unique password (code) generated for single use
- Static code sent via e-mail or SMS text
#### Time-based OTP (TOTP)
- Code is only valid for a short period of time

#### Software notification methods (push notification)
- Phone call
- Short message service (SMS) text
- E-mail

#### HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP)
- HMAC encrypts a hash to ensure authenticity

## Certification-based Authentication

PKI certificates are issued by a trusted authority to an individual entity
- Device, VPN, app access
- Can be stored on a smart card
	- Called a Personal Identity Verification (**PIV**) card 
	- Common access card (**CAC**) can authenticate to everything

*PIV card*
![[Pasted image 20240709180349.png]]

## SSH Public Key Authentication
Sign in with username and password (passphrase) as well as a private key
Public key stored on server
Private key stored on admin device

## Biometrics
Fingerprint
Retina
Iris
Facial
Voice
Vein
Gait analysis | *How you move or walk*

#### Efficacy Rates
- False acceptance
- False rejection
- Crossover error rate
*Imperfections when trying to uniquely identify a person*

# Access Control Schemes

## Credential Policies
#### Defines who gets access to what
- Employees
- Contractors
- Devices
- Service accounts
- Administrator/Root accounts
	- Privileged Access Management (**PAM**)

## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
#### Uses attributes to determine permissions
- Example: Date of birth or device type
	- Such as determing if they're old enough to apply for a drivers license
	- If they can buy an online game

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
A role is a collection of related permissions
Role occupants get permissions of the role
- Create groups and putting people into them

## Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Uses *conditional access* policies
	- *Conditions that need to be met before signing in*
Examples
- MFA
- Device type
- Location
**Notice that there's two that say RBAC**

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
#### Resources are **labeled**
- Devices, files, databases, network ports, etc.

Permission assignments are based on resource labels and security clearance

**Common in high security networks where clearances are needed**

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Data custodian sets permissions at their discretion
- Rules set by the data owner

## Physical Access Control (PAC)
Controlling access to locked doors, security controls, mantraps, locks on equipments racks.
- We don't want people to be able to pull servers out of racks

# Account Management
## User Accounts
Unique account per user
Assign permissions to groups
Principle of least privilege 
User account auditing  | *Checking to see who's in the admin group*
Disablement | *Offboarding, disabling but keeping the data*

## Account Management
#### Rights/privileges
#### Account types
- User, device, service
- Administrator/root
- Privileged
- Guest

*Need to create user account and limit permissions*
![[Pasted image 20240709182327.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240709182347.png]]
*He gave permissions to the account while he was creating it, and then he was asked how he wanted to set the permissions*

![[Pasted image 20240709183135.png]]

*It then created an auto generated password, which will be given to the client*

*Does G1 have permissions? No*

## Account Policies
#### Employee onboarding
#### Password policies
- Complexity
- History
- Reuse
#### Account Lockout

#### Time-based logins
- Enforce login/logout times

#### Geolocation
- Where a user is located
#### Geofencing
- User geolocation determines resources access
#### Geotagging
- Adding location metadata to files and social media posts

#### Impossible travel time
#### Risky login
- A baseline of normal activity is required first

# Network Authentication

## Network Authentication Protocols
#### Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
- Outdated
- Cleartext transmissions
- **DON'T USE IT**

#### Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAPv2)
![[Pasted image 20240709223613.png]]
*Authenticate without transmitting the password, only the hash*

## Microsoft New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)
#### Supersedes older LANMAN protocol
#### Used on Windows workgroup computers
Password hashes with NTLM are **not salted**
 NTLM v2 passwords **are salted**

## Kerberos
#### Microsoft Active Directory Authentication
Kerberos Key Distribution Center (**KDC**)
Authentication Service (**AS**)
Ticket-Granting Service (**TGS**)
Ticket-Granting Ticket (**TGT**)

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
#### Network authentication framework
Examples:
- PKI certificate authentication
- Smart card authentication
#### Uses TLS transport
#### Applies to wired and wireless networks

## IEEE 802.1x
#### Port-based network access control
Centralized RADIUS server authentication
Wired and wireless network edge devices
- Ethernet switches
- Wi-Fi routers
- VPN appliances

## Remote Access Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
#### Centralized authentication
#### RADIUS clients
- Network switch
- VPN appliance
- Wireless router
#### RADIUS supplicant  | **Users signing in from smartphone**

## RADIUS Variations
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (**TACACS**)
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (**TACACS+**)
Extended TACACS (**XTACACS**)

![[Pasted image 20240709235146.png]]
*We don't have to worry about authentication being handled by the edge network device*
- We don't want the edge network device to be storing passwords

# Identity Management Systems
## Single Sign-on (SSO)
User credentials are not requested after initial authentication
#### Protocols
- OpenID
- OAuth

![[Pasted image 20240709235450.png]]
*Notice that OAth2 is being used*

## Identity Federation
Multiple resources that trust a single authentication source
#### Centralized trusted identity provider (**IdP**)
- Trusted by resource provider (**RP**)

#### Security Assertion Markup Language (**SAML**)
- SAML token is a digital security token that proves identity

![[Pasted image 20240709235804.png]]
*SAML token was given to the user by the IdP*
![[Pasted image 20240709235825.png]]
*The user then handed the SAML token to the RP*
