# Wi-Fi Encryption Standards

## Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
##### Part of original 802.11 standard
##### RC4 streaming
##### Began with initializing vector (IV)
##### Problem was with IVs

## IEEE 802.11i
#### AES instead of RC4
#### Pre-shared key (PSK) instead of IV
- Or WPA-Enterprise
	- Authenticate with RADIUS server
#### The problem:
- Most WAPs and network cards couldn't handle AES
#### The solution:
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
- RC4 with PSK or RADIUS server

## IEEE 802.11i
#### WPA2
- AES
- Can do RADIUS or PSK
- Counter-Mode/CBC-MAC protocol
	- CCMP
#### The problem:
- Can be cracked through the handshake
