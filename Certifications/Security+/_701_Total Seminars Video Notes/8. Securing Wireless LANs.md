# Wi-Fi Encryption Standards

## Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
##### Part of original 802.11 standard
##### RC4 streaming
##### Began with initializing vector (IV)
##### Problem was with IVs

## IEEE 802.11i
#### AES instead of RC4
#### Pre-shared key (PSK) instead of IV
- Or WPA-Enterprise
	- Authenticate with RADIUS server
#### The problem:
- Most WAPs and network cards couldn't handle AES
#### The solution:
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
- RC4 with PSK or RADIUS server

## IEEE 802.11i
#### WPA2
- AES
- Can do RADIUS or PSK
- Counter-Mode/CBC-MAC protocol
	- CCMP
#### The problem:
- Can be cracked through the handshake

## WPA3
##### Disallows outdated protocols
##### Protected Management Frames (PMF)
##### Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE)

## Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
##### Must have WPS-capable wireless access points (WAPs) and devices
##### Press button on both WAP and device
##### Creates a WPA2-encrypted connection
##### The Problem:
- Easy to crack
##### The solution:
- Devices no longer us it


# RFID, NFC and Bluetooth

## Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID)
##### Uses RF communication to track objects with RFID tags
##### Range is ~5 meters (16.5 feet)
##### Commonly used for inventory control, locating pets, and in some passports
##### RFID tags are normally powered by the reading/scanning device


## Near Field Communication (NFC)
##### Type of RFID
#### Close-range wireless communications
- Approximately 5cm (1.5 inches)
#### Common uses
- Payment cards
- Smartphone (data sharing, payments)
- Read/write NFC tags

## Bluetooth
#### 802.151 standard
- 2.4 5 Ghz frequency range
#### Wireless networking with shorter range than wi-fi
- Class 1
	- Up to 100 meters (328 feet)
	-  Example: USB wi-fi dongles
- Class 2 
	- 10 meters (33 feet)
	- Example: Bluetooth headset
#### Devices must be paired together to communicate
- Car stereo
- Headset
- Keyboards

#### Bluejacking
- Unauthorized sending of anonymous messages to a Bluetooth device
- Example: sharing bogus contact information with a message as the contact name

## Bluetooth Attacks
#### Bluesnarfing
- Data theft from remote devices using Bluetooth
#### Mitigation
- Disable Bluetooth when not needed


# Wi-Fi Coverage and Performance

## Wi-Fi Coverage and Performance
#### Signal strength weakens over distance
- Transmission power measured in decibel milliwatts (dBm)
- -30 dBm is great, -80 not so great
#### Atmospheric conditions affect wireless connectivity

## Wi-Fi Site Survey
#### Conduct during Wi-Fi deployment and troubleshooting
#### Collect wireless stats
- Signal strength
- Noise
- Channel overlapping
- Transmission speeds

# Wi-Fi Discovery and Attacks

## Wi-Fi Discovery and Mapping
#### War-chalking
- Sidewalk marking
#### War-driving
- Scan from within vehicle
#### War-flying
- Scan using a drone

## Malicious WAP Targeting
#### Rogue access point
- Unauthorized wireless AP
#### Evil Twin
- Unauthorized wireless AP mimicking valid AP name

## Wi-Fi  AP Beacon Frames
#### sent every ~100ms
#### Clients cannot verify beacons
- Key not established yet
- Beacon frames are easily forged
#### Contains
- SSID (WLAN name)
- Maximum transmit power (dBm)

## Wi-Fi Attacks
#### Connecting to open WLANs
#### Cracking WEP passphrase
#### RF signal jamming
- Interference
- Wi-Fi channel overlap
- Flood AP with deauthentication (disassociation) packets
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack

**You need promiscuous mode, and packet injection to use this Linux tool**
- wlan0 is a wifi network

*Built in Linux tool that can scan the vicinity for wifi networks*

*Give it a second*

*PSK shows that it's not using a RADIUS authentication*

# Cracking WPA2

First we need to kick someone off the network and get them to reauthenticate
1. Find a client on the network
2. Kick them off
3. Figure out the PSK

## Disassociation/ Deauthentication Attacks
#### Discover APs
#### Discover connected clients
#### Disconnect active client from AP
- `sudo aireplay-ng -01 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC>`

#### Monitor client -AP handshake
#### Perform online or offline dictionary or brute-force to determine PSK

*`airodump-ng` lets you find wifi networks close to you*
![[Pasted image 20240721153816.png]]
*You will find the SSID, the channel it's using, and the number of connected users*
![[Pasted image 20240721153856.png]]
*When clients connect they will show up at the bottom*

*Open a second channel host.*
- Added flags
	- bssid
	- c for channel
	- write to a file

*He's capturing network traffic so he can watch when a device reauthenticates*

*On a third window, he's trying to deauthenticate *

*He's going to compare it with his wordlist*

# Wi-Fi Hardening

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
#### IEEE 802.1x RADIUS authentication
- Supports identity federation
#### EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
- No certificates
- Shared secret must be configured on both devices
#### EAP-TLS
- Server- and client-side certificates
#### EAP-TTLS
- Requires a server certificate
- Encapsulates RADIUS messages
#### Protected EAP
- Requires a server certificate
- Encapsulates EAP messages

## Wi-Fi Hardening
#### Change default AP credentials
#### Hide the SSID
- WLAN name is removed from AP beacon frames
- Clients must know the SSID to connect
- Clients must know PSK or credentials

#### Enable MAC filtering
#### Use WPA3 Enterprise
- RADIUS server authentication
#### Limit signal emanation
- Transmit power levels

#### Captive Portal
- Landing page (Web site)
- May require user authentication
	- Until authenticated, all HTTP requests show the landing page
- User may only need to agree to terms of use
