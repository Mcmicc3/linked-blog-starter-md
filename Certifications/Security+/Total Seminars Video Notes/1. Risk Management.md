## Defining Risk

#### Risk Management
- Risk is the likelihood of a threat actor taking advantage of a vulnerability by using a threat against an IT asset

#### Asset
- Data, people, servers, equipment, services.
#### Probability
- Probability of an event happening over time
- Chances of someone getting spam emails over a year
#### Threat actors
- Hackers
- Hacktivists
- Script kiddies
- Insiders
- Competitors
- Shadow IT
- Criminal Syndicates
- State actors
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
	- Long term hacking in order to get information over time
#### Vulnerability
- Weaknesses and misconfigurations in an infrastructure
#### Threat
- an exploit by a threat actor through a vulnerbulity to perform an exploit

#### Remediation
- Looks look at all the threats, our infrasturcure, and look at the vulnerability, and based on likelihood, make a decision on what we're going to do on the likilihood of this event happening


QR:
- Risk is the likelihood of a threat actor taking advantage of a vulnerability by using a threat agaisnt an IT asset
- An asset is any part of an IT infrastructure that has value
- Likelihood is the probability of assets being damaged over time
- A threat actor is anyone or anything with the motive and resources to attack another's IT infrastructure
- A threat is an action that a threat actor can use against a vulenrability to cause harm.

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

CIA Triad

#### Vulnerability and Threat
- Vulnerability
	- A weakness inherent in an asset that leaves it open to a threat
- Threat
	- An attack (exploit) that a malicious actor will use against an asset

## Risk Assessments and Treatments

You can't manage what you don't know

#### Risk Assessment
- Prioritize of threats against assets and determining what to do about it
- Applicable to
	- Entire organization
	- A single project or department
- Targets
	- Servers
	- Legacy systems
	- Intellectual property (IP)
	- Software licensing
#### Risk Assessment Process
- Risk awareness
	- Cybersecurity Intelligence sources
- Evaluate security controls
	- Inherent (current) and residual risk
- Implement security controls
- Periodic review

#### Risk Types
- Environmental
	- Flood, Hurricane
- Person-made
	- Riots, terroism, sabotage
- Internal
	- Malicious insider, malware infections
- External
	- Distributed denial of service (DDOS)

#### Risk Treatments
- Mitigation/reduction
	- Security controls are proactively put in place before undertaking the risk
- Transference/sharing
	- Some risk is transferred to a third party in exchange for payment
- Avoidance
	- Avoid an activity becasue the risks outweigh potential gains
- Acceptance
	- The current level of risk is acceptable
	- The risk falls within the organization's risk appetite

QR:
- A risk assessment strives to determine the likelihood and impact of threats
- Risk types include environmental, personmade, internal and external
- Risk treatments (Management) include acceptance, mitigation, transference, and avoidance


## Quantitative Risk Assessments

#### Quantitative Risk Assessment
- Based on numeric values (Is the cost of the fix worth it)
- Asset value (AV) "How much something costs"
- Exposure factor (EF)
	- Percentage of asset value loss when negative incident occurs (expressed as a percentage)

All of this is put together got make the SLE

#### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
- How much loss is experienced during one negative incident?
- Multiply asset value (AV) by the Exposure factor (EF)
$AV * EF = SLE$

- Asset value (AV) = $2400
- Exposure Factor (EF) = 12.5%
- AV * EF = $3,000 (SLE)
![[Pasted image 20240522190528.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240522190541.png]]

#### Quantitative Risk Assessment
- Annualized rate of occurence (ARO)
	- Expected number of yearly occurences
	- Example: 2-3 times per year
- Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
	- Total yearly cost of bad things happening
	- $ALE = SLE * ARO$
![[Pasted image 20240522190830.png]]

QR:
- The single loss expectancy (SLE) is calculated by multiplying the asset value (AV) by the exposure factor (EF)
- The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is calculated by multiplying the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) by the SLE

## Qualitive Risk Assessments

Based on opinions and not hard numbers

#### Qualitative Risk Assessment
- Based on subjective opinions regarding:
	- Threat likelihood
	- Impact of realized threat
- Threats are given a severity rating

#### Risk Register
- Organizations should have one (or more)
- Centralized list of risks, severities, responsibilities, and mitigations
- Generally considered qualitative
	- Example: severity or impact ratings
	- Occasionally includes hard numbers (% $)
![[Pasted image 20240522191250.png]]

#### Risk Heat Map
- Take risk severity levels and map visually by color

![[Pasted image 20240522191455.png]]

#### Risk Matrix
- Table of risk details
- Similar to a heat map but without colors

QR:
- A qualitative risk assessment is based on subjective risk severeity levels
- A risk register is an up-to-date centralized list of risks and their relative severities and mitiagations

#### Anonymization Techniques
- Pseudo-anonmyization
	- Replace PII with fake identifiers
- Data minimization
	- Limit stored/retained sensitive data
- Tokenization
	- A digital token authorizes access instead of the original credentials
