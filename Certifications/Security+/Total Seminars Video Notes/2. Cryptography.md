## Cryptography Basics

Obfuscation: Take something that makes sense, and make it look like something that doesn't make sense

Diffusion: Fuzzy image. Makes things less visible, less obvious

Encryption / decryption

Caesear Cipher

###### Substitution

###### Rot2 (Turning it twice)
![[Pasted image 20240522233946.png]]
three times for ROT3

Cryptanalysis (cracking these codes)

Vigenere Cipher 
- Algorithm, Key
- Works great for the alphabet, but is bad for pictures, SQL databases

Any algorithm out there uses a key.

Exclusive or (XOR) 

![[Pasted image 20240522234701.png]]

Kerckhoff's principle

QR:
- Cryptography is the practice of disguising information in a way that looks random
- The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers
- The Vigenere cipher employs the Caesar cipher as one elemnt of the encryption process



## Data Protection
Data is everywhere. It doesn't always just sit in a database.

#### Data at rest
Sitting in storage somewhere. Nothing is querying or writing the data. 
- Password is stored somewhere
- HDD/SDD
#### Data in use
- You're logging in, and the database is comparing your input what its information.
- Often unencrypted
- Shoulder surfing
- Keyloggers
- RAM

#### Data in Transfer
- Data is moving from one hopefully secure system to another hopefully secure system
- Vulnerable to sniffing
- Man in the middle
- Network

QR:
- Data at rest is housed phsyically on some kind of computer storage
- Data in use is housed in RAM and being accessed
- Data in transit is moving through cables and wireless transmission



## Cryptographic Methods

#### Symmetric Key
- Session Key 
- In-Band (Send the key with the encrypted data)
- Out-of-Band (Physically handing it over)
Symmetric Encyrption is the primary way that we encrypt data

#### Ephemeral Key
- Tempoary
- Provides perfect forward secrecy
- A cracked code six months ago is no use today

#### Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses a key pair
	- Public and private key
- Public key only encryptes
- Private key only decryptes
- Slow and ownereous

Asymmetric encryption is used to send a secure session key
- Go back to regularly 

#### Cryptosystem
- Highly defined pro

QR: 
- Ephemeral Keys provide perfect forward secrecy due to the temporary nature of the key
- Asymmetric encryption is slow but very useful in exchanging session keys
- Crpytosystmes define key properties, communication requirements for the key exchange, and the actions taken through the encryption and decryption process. 
## Symmetric Cryptosystems

Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
- Symmetric key algorithm

#### Symmetric Key Algorithms
- Block
	- Encrypts data in chunks
	- Symmetric block algorithm
	- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
(**Probably not important**)
Initial Permutation
Key
subkey
Feistel Function
Expansion
Sboxes
Final Permutation

#### Symmetric Block Algorithms
- DES
- Blowfish
- Triple DES (3DES)
- Defined by
	- Key length
	- Block size
	- Number of rounds

##### Blowfish
- 64-bit Block size
- 16 rounds
- Key size 32 - 444 bits

![[Pasted image 20240524182409.png]]

AES is everywhere

Alternative to Block ciphers

#### Symmetric Key Cryptosystems
- Streaming 
	- Encrypt one bit at a time
	- Popular in wireless networking
	- RC4
	- Not as popular today

![[Pasted image 20240524182534.png]]

QR:
- Symmetric block algorithms encrypt data in discrete chunks
- Streaming symmetric algorithms encrypt data one bit at a time
- Block algorithms (or ciphers) include the outdated DES, 3DES, and Blowfish, as well as the currently-used AES
- The most used streaming symmetric cipher is RC4

## Symmetric Block Modes (Not on Exam)


Electronic Code Book (ECB) 

#### Block modes
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
Cipher Feedback (CFC)
Output Feedback 
Counter (CTR)

Get around the limitations of symmetric block encyprtions
Randomized data 
Noone uses ECB anymore

QR:
- ECB block modes will always output the smae results with the same input
- A binary block is plain text convertedd into 16-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit binary ciphertext
- CBC, CFC, OFB, CTR block modes use an intialization vector (IV), which ensure the output block is uniquely different


## Asymmetric Cryptosystems
Public and private keys

Asymmetric Cryptography

RSA
- Use factoring
![[Pasted image 20240524183750.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240524183828.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240524183923.png]]

Authentication
- Along with the key, they would encrypt with the private key....confirm where the key originated from
Digital Signature

Secure RSA is 4,096
- Big keys take up overhead and time
- New form needed

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
![[Pasted image 20240524184233.png]]

QR:
- Public keys are paired with a private key (key pair) when using RSA asymmetric cryptography
- ECC can create a smaller key than RSA and provides the same security with increased performance
- Each public key has a single private key, without the private key in the information cannot be decrypted
