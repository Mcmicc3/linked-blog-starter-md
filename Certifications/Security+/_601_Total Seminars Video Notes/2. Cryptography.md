## Cryptography Basics

Obfuscation: Take something that makes sense, and make it look like something that doesn't make sense

Diffusion: Fuzzy image. Makes things less visible, less obvious

Encryption / decryption

Caesear Cipher

###### Substitution

###### Rot2 (Turning it twice)
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240522233946.png]]
three times for ROT3

Cryptanalysis (cracking these codes)

Vigenere Cipher 
- Algorithm, Key
- Works great for the alphabet, but is bad for pictures, SQL databases

Any algorithm out there uses a key.

Exclusive or (XOR) 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240522234701.png]]

Kerckhoff's principle

QR:
- Cryptography is the practice of disguising information in a way that looks random
- The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers
- The Vigenere cipher employs the Caesar cipher as one elemnt of the encryption process



## Data Protection
Data is everywhere. It doesn't always just sit in a database.

#### Data at rest
Sitting in storage somewhere. Nothing is querying or writing the data. 
- Password is stored somewhere
- HDD/SDD
#### Data in use
- You're logging in, and the database is comparing your input what its information.
- Often unencrypted
- Shoulder surfing
- Keyloggers
- RAM

#### Data in Transfer
- Data is moving from one hopefully secure system to another hopefully secure system
- Vulnerable to sniffing
- Man in the middle
- Network

QR:
- Data at rest is housed phsyically on some kind of computer storage
- Data in use is housed in RAM and being accessed
- Data in transit is moving through cables and wireless transmission



## Cryptographic Methods

#### Symmetric Key
- Session Key 
- In-Band (Send the key with the encrypted data)
- Out-of-Band (Physically handing it over)
Symmetric Encyrption is the primary way that we encrypt data

#### Ephemeral Key
- Tempoary
- Provides perfect forward secrecy
- A cracked code six months ago is no use today

#### Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses a key pair
	- Public and private key
- Public key only encryptes
- Private key only decryptes
- Slow and ownereous

Asymmetric encryption is used to send a secure session key
- Go back to regularly 

#### Cryptosystem
- Highly defined pro

QR: 
- Ephemeral Keys provide perfect forward secrecy due to the temporary nature of the key
- Asymmetric encryption is slow but very useful in exchanging session keys
- Crpytosystmes define key properties, communication requirements for the key exchange, and the actions taken through the encryption and decryption process. 
## Symmetric Cryptosystems

Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
- Symmetric key algorithm

#### Symmetric Key Algorithms
- Block
	- Encrypts data in chunks
	- Symmetric block algorithm
	- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
(**Probably not important**)
Initial Permutation
Key
subkey
Feistel Function
Expansion
Sboxes
Final Permutation

#### Symmetric Block Algorithms
- DES
- Blowfish
- Triple DES (3DES)
- Defined by
	- Key length
	- Block size
	- Number of rounds

##### Blowfish
- 64-bit Block size
- 16 rounds
- Key size 32 - 444 bits

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524182409.png]]

AES is everywhere

Alternative to Block ciphers

#### Symmetric Key Cryptosystems
- Streaming 
	- Encrypt one bit at a time
	- Popular in wireless networking
	- RC4
	- Not as popular today

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524182534.png]]

QR:
- Symmetric block algorithms encrypt data in discrete chunks
- Streaming symmetric algorithms encrypt data one bit at a time
- Block algorithms (or ciphers) include the outdated DES, 3DES, and Blowfish, as well as the currently-used AES
- The most used streaming symmetric cipher is RC4

## Symmetric Block Modes (Not on Exam)


Electronic Code Book (ECB) 

#### Block modes
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
Cipher Feedback (CFC)
Output Feedback 
Counter (CTR)

Get around the limitations of symmetric block encyprtions
Randomized data 
Noone uses ECB anymore

QR:
- ECB block modes will always output the smae results with the same input
- A binary block is plain text convertedd into 16-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit binary ciphertext
- CBC, CFC, OFB, CTR block modes use an intialization vector (IV), which ensure the output block is uniquely different


## Asymmetric Cryptosystems
Public and private keys

Asymmetric Cryptography

RSA
- Use factoring
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524183750.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524183828.png]]

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524183923.png]]

Authentication
- Along with the key, they would encrypt with the private key....confirm where the key originated from
Digital Signature

Secure RSA is 4,096
- Big keys take up overhead and time
- New form needed

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240524184233.png]]

QR:
- Public keys are paired with a private key (key pair) when using RSA asymmetric cryptography
- ECC can create a smaller key than RSA and provides the same security with increased performance
- Each public key has a single private key, without the private key in the information cannot be decrypted

## Diffie-Hellman
You don't want a lot of authentication, just a session key
Doesn't provide encryption

#### Diffie-Hellman
- Asymmetric Algorithm
- Provides a methodology for 2 parties to come up with the same session key

Uses Asymmetric algorithms, but doesn't create public and private keys

Sometimes called **Key agreement/exchange protocol
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240528184527.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240528184534.png]]

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240528184604.png]]

Subject to potential cracking since it is integer based

QR:
- Diffie-Hellman is an asymmetric algorithm often referred to as a key exchange agreement
- Diffie-Hellman groups help by defining the size or type of key structure to use
- Diffie-Hellman can have very large keys

## Hashing

**Integrity**

Hashes will always come out the same length

#### MD5
- Invented in 1992
- Ron Rivest
- 128 bit hash

#### SHA
- Developed by NIS
- SHA-1 (Earliest version)
- 160 bit hash

They both have the ability to create a collision
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240528232936.png]]
Neither is used anymore, replaced with SHA2 or 
#### SHA256 or 512

#### R1PEMD
- Not very common
- Open standard
- 128, 160, 256, 320 bit digests 

QR:
- Hashes are one-way, deterministic, and will produce the same results each time the source is hashed
- The length of the source data does not matter; the hash will be the same exact size
- Hashes are involved with password storage and encryption


## Understanding Digital Certificates
Web server passes a public key to other websites

Two problems: How do you know this public key came from this private key?
- Watchout for man in the middle and spoofing
- Is this really the private key? Is this the website I want?
- **This is an authentication issue**

Web server sends the public key, and uses the private key to encrypt. Hash it, send it over, and if it matches, then you can verify that it came from the public key
- **Digital signature in essence**

Public key, with an associate digital signature
- How do we know it's the user they claim to bring?
- **This is why we bring in a 3rd party**

Normally in a key exchange, you get a public key along with a digital signature, and a digital signature from a trusted 3rd party. 
- **This creates a digital certificate**

You can also assign yourself the second digital signature
- **Self signed certificate**
- Save money

QR:
- Digital signatures verify that the person who sent the public key legitimately owns the private key
- Digital certificates include verification from a third party to authenticate the owner of the digital signature

## Trust Models
"I don't trust anyone, I'm going to **self sign** the second signature to create a digital certificate"

When you get on the public internet, no one will trust you
#### Web of trust
- Find other people who are also using the same digital certificate
- A lot of people who trust each other
- ![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529000217.png]]

- Little traction, but it didn't take off

Instead we see PKI Everywhere
#### PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
- Certificate Authority (CA) is at the top of the hiearchy
- ![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529000327.png]]
- They get busy, so between us and the CAs, are the intermediate CAs to help take the load off
- ![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529000408.png]]

Self sign, web of trust, pki

QR:
- Web of trust uses a network of mutually-trusting peers
- Public key infrastructure (PKI) uses a hiearchical structure with certificate authorities (CAs) and intermediate CAs

## Public Key Infrastructure
**Is not a standard**, it's an idea of how things should work

#### X.509
- Method to let individual systems, query other systems that are storing things like certificates 
#### Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
- Organizes certificates, and controls what they are used for

#### Certificate Authority (CA)
- Root certificate (precious)

#### Intermediate CA (ICAs)
- Does all the work
- Sometimes the Actual CA is offline
- Used when you're first setting up your web servers

#### Registration Authority (RA)
- Third authority
- Handles registration for people who are trying to generate new certificates to get their servers online

#### Certificate Chaining
- A chain of intermediate CAs
- Always a root, a few ICAs, and servers that need the CAs themselves

QR:
- X.509 is a method to query systems that store certificates and also includes standards for constructing digital certificates
- Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) gives details on digitial certificate construction and use
- Certificate Authorities (CAs) or registration authorities (RAs) identifiy and authenticate indigivuald registering for certificate; the middle entities are called intermediate CAs, the entity at the top of the hiearchy is called the root CA
- A self-signed certificate is one that is authorized by the same entity who registers for the digital certificate (these should not be trusted outside an internal network)

## Certificate Types

All certificates are created using the X.509 standard

comodo.com sells certificates
letsencrypt.com

#### Domain Validation (DV) certificate
- Most basic certificate there is. One domain

#### Wildcard
- I will take `*totalsem.com`
- Not all websites start with www

#### Extended validation (EV) certificate
- More expensive
- Gives people more confidence to put in credit cards
- Amazon and Google uses this

#### Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificate
- Limited wildcard
- We can pick www, feldspar.totalsem.com. 

These are listed as certs for the web

Now we move onto email
#### E-mail certifiacte
- Not as common. Comodo will sell an emil fertificate
- In house company email. Import into email client, and send encypt emails

#### Signed email
- Regular email, with certificate so we have a users public key
- We can encrypt emails 

#### Code-signing certificate

#### Machine/computer/hardware certificates

#### User certificates

#### Wireless network certificates

QR:
- Digital certificates store a public key with a digital signature, personal information about the resources, and a second digital signature from a trusted third party
- Digital certificates come in many forms including Web (which includes DV, EV, wildcard, and SAN), e-mail, code-signing, machine/computer, and user

## Touring Certificates


Certificates is stored in teh same palce in Windows
- Internet options ---> Content ---> Certificates
- It's faster to store a copy of the certificate onto the system
- When you're updating software, you're also updating certificates 
Fingerprints are basically a hash of a certificate

**All we care about is the expiration date**
You can import and export certificates. 

##### Certificate Export Wizard 
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529171409.png]]

### Exam Tip
**P7B** is just a certificate no private key
**PKCS12** (**p12)**  is not only the certificate, but also the private key


QR:
- Expired certificates are included in a certificate authority's published list called a certificate revocation list (CRL)
- P7B files include the certificate and chain certificates, no private key
- P12 files include the certificate, chain certificates, and the private key

## Cryptographic Attacks

Cryptanalyiss - breaking cryptography

Attack AES is extremely difficult (Attack the algorithm)
- Trick someone into using a weaker encryption.

Attack the Implementation

#### Cryptosystems
Wired Equivealent Privacy (WEP)

RC4 wasn't weak, it was the implementation that was weak

#### Attack the key
- If I can figure out what the key is,
- Key does not equal password
- Some keys have salts

QR:
- Cryptographic attacks can be put into three main categories; attack the algorithm, implementation, or key
- Attacking the algorithm is nearly impossible for the most up-to-date standards, as crackable algorithms are usually taken out of production.
- Attacking the implementation means taking advantage of weaknesses in how the connection is made
- Attacking the key means somehow figuring out the key in order to break in


## Password Cracking

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529184902.png]]

#### Brute force

#### Dictionary attack
- Text file with millions of human words
- Free online

#### Rainbow table
- List of human sounding names and hashes corresponding
- Faster

#### Offline attack
- Steal the hash, and use your tool offline

### Salting
Anyone can see the sale
- Add an arbitrary string of characters after the actual password and then hash that
- ![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240529185233.png]]
- SHA256

#### Key stretching
- Wireless network, WPA requires a shared key, for anyone who wants to join the SSID
- Built into 8.211 is **Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2(PBKDF2)**
- Takes the key we typed, adds the SSID, hashes it 4000x times. 
- Complicated in Wireless networks

Rainbow tables vs brute force vs dictionary attacks
We protect our passwords via salting and key stretching

QR:
- Passwords are usually stored in hash format, making them difficult to crack
- Brute-force attacks try character combinations
- Dictionary attacks use lists of probable passwords
- Rainbow tables use pre-calculated hashes of passwords
- Salting and key stretching adds another layer of obfuscation, making passwords even harder to crack than just hashing
