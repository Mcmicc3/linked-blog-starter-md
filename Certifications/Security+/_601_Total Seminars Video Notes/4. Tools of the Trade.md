# Touring the CLI

cmd

Terminal Programs get shells?

#### Ping and ipconfig
ipconfig /all
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew

dns
dhcp
ipconfig /flushdns
ifconfig
ip a

QR:
- Windows offers both the standard Command shell as well as the more robust PowerShell
- macOS uses Terminal as the command-line interface (CLI)
- Linux CLIs are often referred to as the terminal, shell, console, bash or prompt
- ping queries other systems on a TCP/IP network to test connectivitiy
- ipconfig (Windows) and ifconfig (macOS/Linux) show the current status of the network settings for a host system
# Shells

#### Command-Line Environments
- Windows, Microsoft, Linux shells
- Python (Has a shell)
- Benefits?
	- If you can type, you can script
	- Automation via scripts

#### Reverse Shells
- Attackers often try to get a reverse shell (backdoor)
- Netcat can provide a reverse shell = nc
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530164111.png]]
Victim accidentally runs the nc command
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530164131.png]]

#### Reverse Shells
- Advanced persistent threat (APT)
	- Attacker has a way into the system repeatedly
- Tools
	- netcat (nc)
	- Metasploit framework
	- Cobalt Strike

QR :
- Command-line environments include the Windows command prompt, Microsoft Powershell, Linux Shells, and Python scripts
- Reverse shells involve victoms' stations contacting attacker stations listening for connections
- Reverse shells can be used as an advanced persistent threat (APT)


# The Windows Command Line

#### Windows Command Line
- cmd.exe
- May need admin privileges to run
	- You can also run as admin to save time typing things that need admin privileges
- Batch file scripts (.bat)

##### Commands
hostname
whoami
notepad

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530164712.png]]
`Saved the file as test.bat in the root of drive `

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530171423.png]]

#### Environment Variables
- Sometimes applications need a specific variable name
- The command to list the environment variables is `set`
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530171521.png]]
`favecolor is now saved in the environment varaibles`

You can start powershell from within a cmd
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240530171706.png]]

QR:
- The windows comamnd prompt is spawned from cmd.exe
- Batch file scripts have a .bat extension
- Common Windows commands include whoami, ipconifg, and powershell

# Microsoft PowerShell

#### Microsoft Powershell
- Can run in Windows, Linux, macOS
- Powershell.exe
- Object-oriented
	- Output is an object
	- Each object has attributes and properties
- May need to run with elevated privileges
- PowerShell scripts (.ps1)

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531003757.png]]
`You can manage hosts on VMware for example`
- You can manage disks, the cloud, etc.

**Exam Tips**
- Understand the logic behind powershell, don't get caught up on syntax

QR:
- Powershell is an object-oriented command-line tool
- PowerShell works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- PowerShell cmdlets take the form of verb-noun (get-service)

# Linux Shells

#### Linux Shells
- Syntax is case-sensitive
- Various types of shells
	- C shell
	- Korn shell
	- Bourne again shell (bash)
- Shell scripts (.sh)
	- Must be flagged as executable
- Don't sign in with the root account
- sudo command prefix
	- Runs commands with elevated privileges
	- User must be listed in sudoers
- Remotely accessible via Secure Shell (SSH) over TCP port 22

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531005055.png]]
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`
- Where did it put the keys?

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531005246.png]]
`This is where the public key is stored`
- This is to setup secure SSH communication on Linux

/mnt
ifconfig

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531005453.png]]

QR:
- Linux shells are case-sensitive
- Linux shells are not object-orientated
- Linux shell scripts normally end with .sh and must be flagged as executable
- The sudo command prefix runs with elevated privileges


# Python Scripts

#### Python
- Multi-platform
- Supports more complex needs than shell scripts
- Syntax is case-sensitive
- Python scripts (.py)

`ctrl+d to close python on shell`

`user@group $ nano test.py`
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531005938.png]]

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531010005.png]]

You need permission to run python scripts
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531010111.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240531010119.png]]
`Executables are green`

QR: 
- Python scripts run on any platform with a Python interpreter installed
- Python is case-sensitive and is generally more powerful than Linux shell scripts


# Windows Command-Line Tools

**Tip**: You'll be shown output, and you have to guess which device created the output

ipconfig
arp -a

#### Windows Command-Line Tools
- arp
	- Address resolution protocol (arp)
	- Converts IP address to NIC MAC address mapping
	- Shows arp table in memory
-
