# Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

#### Identification
- Drivers license

#### Authentication
- Badge

#### Authorization
- What can I do?

#### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- Using more than one factor of authentication
- Factors
	- Something you know, have or are

#### Authentication Attributes
- Something you do (Hand Signature)
- Something you exhibit (typing speed)
- Something you know (People you know)
- Somewhere you are (location, zip code)

QR:
- Identification is claiming an identity
- Authentication is proving that identity
- Authorization is permitting specific actions once a user has been authenticated 
- Authentication factors include something you know, have, or are
- Authentication attributes include something you do, know, or somewhere you are

# Enabling Multifactor Authentication

#### Identification and AAA
- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accounting
	- Auditing

Showed us an example of setting up MFA on Azure

QR:
- Identification and authentication allow for authorization on a system
- Accounting is the process of auditing, or accounting for, the activities of a user while they are on a system
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is more secure than single-factor authentication


# Authorization
Proves one identity (user, device, or software)

#### Authorization
- Based on permissions granted
- Determines resource permission
- Can only occur after authentication
- Resources
	- Targets that have permissions applied to them
	- Example: files, database rows, Web app

#### Accounting/Auditing
- Track permissions usage for accountability purposes
- Who or what accessed which resource, how long, on what date?

##### Managed Identity - something on Azure

QR:
- Authorization is based on permissions that are granted to a user or entity
- Authorization can only occur after authentication
- Accounting is tied to authentication in that a user's activity is audited based on what a user has permission to do on a system


# Accounting

#### Accounting
- Often called auditing
- Track activity
- Must have separate user accounts for each user
- Types of auditing
	- Resource access
	- Failed Logon attempts
	- Changes to files/database records

QR: 
- Accounting (or auditing) is the process of tracking user activity on a system
- Separate user accounts are important to assure accurate accounting
- Event (or accounting) logs can be used to identify unusual or malicious activity

# Authentication Methods

#### Authentication Methods
- Username/password
	- Security risk  because they are both something you know and can be guessed
	- Also a security risk because common passwords are still widely used
	- Mitigation is to use different passwords for each resource
- Password vaults
	- Also called "password managers"
	- Examples: LastPass, cloud-based vaults to store password keys
- A master key protects the vault
	- Don't forget it!!

#### One-Time Password (OTP)
- Unique password (code) generated for single use
	- Static code sent via e-mail or SMS text
- Time-based OTP (**TOPT**)
	- Code is only valid for a short period of time
- Software notification methods (push notification) 
	- Phone call
	- Short message service (SMS) text
	- E-mail
- HMAC-based One-time password (**HOTP**)
	- HMAC encrypts a hash to ensure authenticity

#### Certificate-Based Authentication 
- PKI certificates are issued by a trusted authoritry to an individual entity
	- Device, VPN, app access
	- Can be stored on a smart card
		- Called a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card 
		- Common access card (CAC) can authenticate to everything

#### SSH Public Key Authentication
- Sign in with username and password (passphrase) as well as a private key
- Public key stored on server
- Private key stored on admin device

#### Biometrics
- Fingerprint
- Retina
- Iris
- Facial
- Voice
- Vein
- Gait analysis (How you move or walk)
- Efficacy rates
	- False acceptance (incorrect matches)
	- False rejection 
	- Crossover error rate

QR:
- Password vaults provide centralized password storage and are protected with a master key
- One-time passwords (OTPs) are a single-use code used to enhance authentication
- Time-based OTPs are called TOTPs
- HMAC-based OTPs (HOTPs) use encryption for added authentication
- Biometric authentication uses physical characteristics to authenticate people

# Access Control Schemes

#### Credential Policies
- Defines who gets access to what
	- Employees
	- Contractors
	- Devices
	- Service accounts (fake user account given to a software component **Managed Identity**)
	- Administroator/root accounts
		- Privileged access management (PAM)

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Uses attributes to determine permissions
	- Example: Date of birth or device type

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- A role is a collection of related permissions
- Role occupants get permissions of the role 

#### Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Same acronym, watch out**
- Uses conditional access policies
- Examples
	- MFA
	- Device type
	- Location
- Can't log in until all the conditions are met

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Resources are labeled
	- Devices, files, databases, network ports, etc. 
- Permission assignments are based on resource labels and security clearance

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Data custodian sets permissions at their discretion
- Data owner assigns permissions to who it shares files to

#### Physical Access Control
- Limited facility access
- Example:
	- Access control vestibules, door locks, proximity cards, key fob, etc.

QR:
- Credential policies determine how credentials are managed and used to access resources
- Resource permissions can be based on user and device attributes (ABAC), rules (RBAC), or roles (RBAC)
- Resource permissions can also be controlled via labels and security clearance levels (MAC) or set by a resource custodian (DAC)
- Physical access control methods include access control vestibules, door locks, limited facility access
# Account Management

#### User Accounts
- Unique account per user
- Assign permissions to groups
- Principle of least privilege
- User account auditing (Tracking failed login attempts)
- Disablement (during offboarding) 
	- Maybe it's wise to keep their data for their replacement

#### Account Management
- Rights/privileges
- Account types
	- User, device, service
	- Administrator/root
	- Privileged
	- Guest

#### Account Policies
- Employee onboarding
- Password policies
	- Complexity
	- History
	- Reuse
- **Local Security Policy**
- Account Lockout
- Time-based logins
	- Enforce login/logout times
- Geolocation
	- Where a user is located
- Geogencing
	- User geolocation determines resources access
- Geotagging
	- Adding location metadata to files and social media posts
- Impossible travel time  (Tracks if they signing in from multiple geographical regions)
	- Undermined by VPNs and Tor networks
	- Risky login
		- A baseline of normal activity is required first

QR:
- Different types of user accounts can have different account policies applied
- Each user should ahve their own account with only the permissions required to perform job tasks
- Password policies control password complexity, histroy, and expiration
- Assigning permissions to groups is scalable 
- Geofencing uses the device's physical location to determine resource access
# Network Authentication

#### Network Authentication Protocols
- Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
	- Outdated 
	- Cleartext transmissions
- Microsoft Challenge Handshake authentication Protocol (MS-CHAPv2)

![[Pasted image 20240529231539.png]]

#### Microsoft New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)
- Supersedes older LANMAN protocol
- Used on Windows workgroup computers
- Password hashes with NTLM are not salted
- NTLM v2 passwords are salted

#### Kerberos
- Microsoft Active Directory authentication 
- Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
- Authentication Service (AS)
- Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
- Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)
- When you authenticate with Kerberos, which is used by active directory. 

#### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
- Network authentication framework
- Examples
	- PKI certificate authentication
	- Smart card authentication
- Uses TLS transport
- Applies to wired and wireless networks

#### IEEE 802.1x
- port-based network access control
- Centralized RADIUS server authentication
- Wired and wireless network edge devices
	- Ethernet switches
	- Wi-Fi routers
	- VPN appliances

#### Remote Access Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
- Centralized authentication
- RADIUS clients 
	- Network switch
	- VPN appliance
	- Wireless router
- RADIUS Supplicant

#### RADIUS Variations
- Terminal access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)
- Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
- Extended TACACS (XTACACS)

![[Pasted image 20240529232240.png]]

QR:

- PAP and MS-CHAPv2 are older network authentication protocols
- NTLM is used for authentication in a Windows workgroup environment
- Kerberos is used for authentication and resource access in an Active Directory environment
- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework supporting many authentication standards
- RADIUS uses a centralized authentication server as opposed to an edge device performing authentication


# Identity Management Systems

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User credentials are not requested after initial authentication
	- When it asks you to sign in with google or Facebook
- Protocols
	- OpenID
	- OAuth

#### Identity Federation
- Multiple resources that trust a single authentication source
- Centralized trusted identity provider (idP)
	- Trusted by resource provider (RP)
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
	- SAML token is a digital security token that proves identity

![[Pasted image 20240529232953.png]]

**SAML token was given from the idP to the User, and the user handed it off to the RP**

QR:
- SSO allows users to sign in once yet access many services without re-entering credentials
- Identity federation uses a centralized trusted identity provider that provides authentication tokens consumed by other resources such as Web sites
