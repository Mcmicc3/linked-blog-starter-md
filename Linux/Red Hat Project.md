# Linux Directories
The shell executes the actual command

/BIN : Holds all of your programs. Known as binaries
/BOOT: has all files that boot the system (grub, ram image)
/Home: Has all system user's home directory
/DEV: Holds devices connected to the system:
- block devices like hard drives
- Null which discards all data sent to it
- Network interface Cards
- Urandom that contains a random characters
- 
/ETC: Holds configuration files or system wide setttings
- /etc passwd or /etc/group - system configurations
- /etc/hostname - system name
- /etc/ssh - service configuration file

/Run: stores runtime information
- process Ids
- Sockets
- Logs

/SBIN: Stands for system binaries
- Usually used during the early stages of system boot
- Initializes the file system or network interface cards.
- Oncludes the binary used to power off a system

/TMP: Temporary directory where processes can create and share files
- Will periodically clean itself and delete all content 
- You can put files in there you know will be deleted later

/USR: A catch all directory for anything user related
- /usr/bin executable programs
- /usr/lib libraries used by binaries
- /usr/share data files shared to all users

/var: Stores system variable data:
- /var/log Logs generated by the system
- /var/tmp Temporary files that stay after a reboot
- /var/www Default location for web server files

Hard links vs sym links

**Another way to remember it**

|Location|Purpose|
|:--|:--|
|`/boot`|Files to start the boot process.|
|`/dev`|Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.|
|`/etc`|System-specific configuration files.|
|`/home`|Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.|
|`/root`|Home directory for the administrative superuser, `root`.|
|`/run`|Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the `/var/run` and `/var/lock` directories from earlier versions of RedÂ Hat Enterprise Linux.|
|`/tmp`|A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The `/var/tmp` directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.|
|`/usr`|Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the `/usr` directory include the following commands:<br><br>- `/usr/bin`: User commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/sbin`: System administration commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/local`: Locally customized software|
|`/var`|System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under `/var`.|

# Process Commands: ps, top... 
ps
- Shows processes, but not current

top
htop
- There's a difference between the two...
- Shows CPU/memory usage in realtime

**Relearn chmod**
- 755
- 4 represents read
- **Read, Write, Execute**
- **R = 4, W = 2, E = 1**
- **User, Group, Everyone else**
System users manages web servers and databases

**pgrep**: lists processes based on criteria

**pkill**: sends a signal to processes matching criteria
- Kill everything for a certain user
