UNDERSTANDING GITHUB
--------------------

[ Working Directory ]  →  [ Staging Area ]  →  [ Local Repository ]  →  [ GitHub ]
   (your files)             (selection)          (history)             (remote)

GITHUB STEPS
------------
git pull --rebase (As soon as you open Obsidian)
git add {., or whatever you want to push}
git commit -m "{Explain changes}"
git push
git reset   (If you want to erase commits and start over)


NEXT STEPS
---------

If you want next steps, I recommend:

Setting up the Obsidian Git plugin safely (now that .deb is installed)

Adding a .gitignore tuned for Obsidian

Creating a “new computer checklist” so future setups take 5 minutes

Adding an i3 keybinding to open Obsidian instantly

WHY DOES OBSIDIAN AUTOMATICALLY WRITE TO `To Do.md` AFTER I OPEN IT EVERYTIME?
