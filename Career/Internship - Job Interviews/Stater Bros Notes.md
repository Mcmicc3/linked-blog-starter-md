3s
1st is success
I have been blank, or my background in
I have been studying IT and cybersecurity for the past five years, and I am currently in my senior year at CSUSB where I am studying for my bachelors degree and focusing more on the security aspect of IT. I'm expected to graduate in the spring of 2025. I get involved in extra curricular activities on campus, including the cyber security club which is hosted inside the jack h brown hall, where I am currently taking all my classes. In those five years I obtained my associates in Cyber, as well as my CompTIA A+ and Network + certs, With that knowledge, I worked for a security camera company named Hikvision, where I was able to offer the IT skills I developed in my academics by learning how to configure and troubleshoot their vast catalog of products to their customers over the phone, and sometimes by remoting into their computer in a timely manner.

2nd is strength
My strengths are my interpersonal skills and being able to communicate IT effectively to describe issue and provide troubleshooting solutions to folks who are either technical or non technical. And, I consider myself to be a curious, and dedicated life long learner who enjoys working in this industry, because, of the joy it brings me, in being able to use these skills I've developed to help other people. 

3rd situation (How does my background apply here)
What I am looking for is an internship opportunity where I can expand my skills and experience in cyber security, while helping stater brothers and it's clients at the same time. Is this in line with what you're looking for?

Tell me about yourself: I'm a dedicated life long learner who is curious and passionate about IT. I have studied IT for about Five years. I received my associates studying Cyber, where I studied and obtained my CompTIA A+. That's when I discovered my interest in IT, and From there I study at CSUSB, where I obtained my Network+. I'm currently a Senior now, and my goals are to get the trifecta with the security+, and focus my goals towards learning more security based skills and concepts, so I can start working towards my niche. I'm currently learning about different aspects of IT security from Network security to penetration testing, forensics, and I'm finding what interets me and looking for new opportunities in cyber where I can develop new skills to enhance my capabilities, while providing quality service to other people.
