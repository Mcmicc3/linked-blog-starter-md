Why does this problem exist, and this is how we're going to approach it.

Logicalaly go through what exist and what has been done.

Here's the seminal aerticals, here's what we're going to do different.

Have a work plan, we know when the deadlines are. Be feasable

Do not think the best way to do this is last minute.

Big names like Ed Ziegler might show up and offer jobs

If people help a lot (someone from the lab), we can give them an acknowledgement.
- Remember, if someone's willing to help, they're not obliged to our deadlines. 

Do we need to commit to an exact number of CVEs?
- Meaningful CVEs at this point
- Create a criteria, two or four that interest us, then come up with a reason why we're doing this few. Is a there a common theme here that will benefit our research

They tend not to use commerifcal tools anything they use in that agency, they have to crea it themselves. They don't know where the supply chain come from, this is their chance to have us test commerical stuff.
