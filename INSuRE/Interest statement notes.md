- sHOOTINT PACKETS OUT, NORMALLY IT WOULD RESEND everything,

but since it's huge, it's normal that it would lose some packets, UDP

These new algorithms use TCP, which is better but still slow.
RSA speech 
How it will work with AI

WILL BREAK current public and private key excahnge algorithms
Current algorithms user 21 integers, and quantam will break them

We need to make algorithms that can withstand that, hence post quantam cryptography.

Four approved post quantam cryptographic......How much quantam computing has potential in the future, but that growth in computer power could create vulnerabilities. Unpredictable of effects of strong computing power

### Mitre

Pyramid of pain,  Demonstrates indication of comprimise that is more impactful than others
outcomes of the plan - Focus on artifacts, 
abstraction maps??? 
Bear APTS?
Lazarus group from north korea (Sony Hack, WannaCry)

Components to the project,  Frame, to frame our thinking on how threat actors work.

What their normal tactics are, to define how they do things. 

Track APTs, looking at artifacts, specific things identified in the attack. 

Foresnics analysis, 
artifcats, anything that is left over (log file)
APTs are government, hacktivist groups, 
Equation group for hackers. 
Cyber Psychology, tacticts, procedures, 

Built their own enviroment, and setup their own detection....
