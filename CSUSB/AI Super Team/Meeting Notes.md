## Obscure AI topics to look into
Rag AI
- He downloaded a book, then he went to https://coyotegpt.ngrok.app/auth
- He used Rag AI, gave it the book on cooking, it's processing it.

- Find book professional cooking. 
- If the dataset isn't correct, if you don't ask the right questions, your model is trash.
