A text to speech project where I say things like how I normally would to express something in business
- What do you mean by that?
- I don't think that' right?
- Can you tell more about, I don't get it
- That's the dumbest thing I ever heard

You speak exactly what you want to say, the AI listens to you, and responds back rewording what you say but in professional speak

*Like that one skit in key & Peele with Barack Obama ana his translator.*
