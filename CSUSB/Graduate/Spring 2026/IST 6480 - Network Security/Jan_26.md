Plenum rated cables

Wiring/port color schemes

Naming conventions for cabling
* Naming ports Room 131 South Wall (131W)

We're allowed to pull wire that is below 50 volts 

Steel stud and wood stud matters for IT 
* Wood studs always have a fireblock. Makes wiring complicated
* Steel studs, no woodblock, much easier to wire

You always want to pull more than one cable through the wall. 

Thinking about what to avoid when wiring
* Intentionally wiring over doors, because door's typically don't move
* Want to avoid furniture, you never know if a room will be completely redesigned.
* Do not run wires parallel with fluorescent lights, creates too much noise. 
	* Engines creates noise too.
* Think about all the things you'd find in the ceiling, or floorboard.

How switches talk to each other
- Connecting them both directly to each other with ethernet.
- or from the back with ribbon cables if they're the same brand

Firewalls:
- Small for remote jobs. Large for in house

Fiber optic:
* Different connectors: LC,SC,ST
* DIfference between single mode and multimode
* Do everything with big circles (Don't want it to kink???)
* Fiber connection always goes one direction, that's why they always come in pairs.

Sometimes the IT closet gets shared with the janitor room lol
