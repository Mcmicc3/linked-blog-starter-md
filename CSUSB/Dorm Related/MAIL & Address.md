# MAIL AND PACKAGES
DHRE provides mail and package handling services to all students living on-campus. Mail and
packages can ONLY be received at the DHRE mail room; village buildings or front desks cannot
receive mail or packages directly. The mail room is located in Coyote Village (Cajon Hall) just
across from the Coyote Village Front Desk. Once received, packages and other trackable mail
are processed and can be picked up during posted mail room hours.

If a student wishes to receive non-trackable mail and flats (for example, magazines and
newspapers), students can request a mailbox from the mail room (located in the Coyote Village
breezeway across from the Coyote Village front desk). Mail will be distributed to assigned
mailboxes. All non-trackable mail/flats are processed and delivered via the mail room the day
they are received. CSUSB and DHRE are not responsible for lost or stolen items, condition of
mail upon receipt, or delays in delivery or pick up. Please wait until you receive an email
confirmation from DHRE that your package has arrived and been processed before you attempt
to pick it up.
