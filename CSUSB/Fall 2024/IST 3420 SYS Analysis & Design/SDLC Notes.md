# Kanban
## What is it?
Kanban is a visual work management system that provides a clear representation of work progression within a process. It offers a visual depiction of both the workflow process and the tasks in transit.
- *Visual Management Method*
- Means signboard or billboard in Japanese

## What's the goal?
The primary aim of Kanban is to pinpoint any possible obstructions in your process and resolve them, enabling work to move efficiently at an optimal pace, thus ensuring cost-effectiveness.
- Improves flow
- Reduce lead time? 
- Visualize work flow
- Limit Work-in-progress
- Manage Flow
Manage the flow of projects from start to completion, without unnesccary slowdown or stoppage. By reducing work in progress, Kanban helps reduce works in progress. Helps resist delays, reduces time to work. Lean and Agile work. 
## Historical Perspective
It all started in the early 1940s. The first Kanban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno(Industrial Engineer and Businessman) for Toyota automotive in Japan. It was created as a simple planning system, the aim of which was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally.

A key reason for the development of Kanban was the inadequate productivity and efficiency of Toyota compared to its American automotive rivals. With Kanban, Toyota achieved a flexible and efficient just-in-time production control system that increased productivity while reducing cost-intensive inventory of raw materials, semi-finished materials, and finished products.

A Kanban system ideally controls the entire value chain from the supplier to the end consumer. In this way, it helps avoid supply disruption and overstocking of goods at various stages of the manufacturing process. Kanban requires continuous monitoring of the process. Particular attention needs to be given to avoid bottlenecks that could slow down the production process. The aim is to achieve higher throughput with lower delivery lead times. Over time, Kanban has become an efficient way in a variety of production systems.

## Strengths
Reduces the amount of doing assignements, so that way we're not taking on new assignments, and preventing uneccessary slowdown
