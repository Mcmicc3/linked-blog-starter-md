[2. Introduction to Software Development Methodologies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hr2yTNnk3c-fxiX7mi44WLADRkR4ssv3/edit#slide=id.p1)

# Learning Objectives
- Introduce systems development life cycle
    
- Introduce SDLC methodologies
	- Agile Example: Apply hands SCRUM project management using burndown charts on Scavenger Hunt application development.
- Introduce Team roles & skill sets

## Systems Development Life Cycle - SDLC
- planning:
	- Project initiation
	- Project approval
	- Delveirebales: system request
- Analysis:
	- Anaylsis strategy
	- Requirements gatehr
	- Deliverables: system proposal

- Answer is B

## SDLC Methodologies
- What is a Software Development Methodology SDM?
	- A formalized approach or series of steps
- There are several categories of Methodologies SDM
	- Structured
	- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
	- Agile development

- Categories of methodolgoeis:
	- Strcutrued
		- Waterfall method
		- Parallel Development
	- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
		- Phased Development
		- Prototyping
		- Throw-away prototyping
	- Agile development
		- eXtreme Programming (XP)
		- SCRUM

| Reduces Scheduled Time                           | Sub-projects May Be Difficult to Integrate |
| Less Chance of Rework in comparison to Waterfall |                                            |
# Structured development technologies
1. Categorized methodologies
2. Waterfall method
3. Parallel Development

# Rapid application development
1. Phased development
2. Prototyping
3. Throw-away prototyping


- RAD methodologies:
	- Phased Development
		- A series of versions
	- Prototyping
		- System prototyping
	- Throw-away prototyping
		- Design prototyping

## Phased Development Methodology

# Agile Methodologies
What are agile methodolies?
- A combination of **iterative and incremental** process models with focus on process **adapatability** and **customer satisfaction** by **rapid delivery** of working product
- Each iteration deliver a product build (version)
- Each increment aims to enhance and improve the previous build.

| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Core Values** | **Key Principles**               |
| Communication   | Continuous testing               |
| Simplicity      | Simple coding                    |
| Feedback        | Close interaction with end users |
| Courage         |                                  |

## Scrum
- Each iteration is called a sprint could be one week period or more.
- All team members gather for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint led by the Scrum Master
- Project progress via a series of sprints

## SCRUM Core Values

| Commitment      | Sprint, team, and individual based commitments.                                                                                      |
| Courage         | Scrum team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.                                                |
| Respect         | Scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.                                                             |
| Openness        | Investigate reality with a specific end goal to make sensible adjustments (reflect on up to date Kanban boards and burndown charts). |
| Focus           | Iterative-incremental approach and timely delivery in Scrum helps to keep the team stay focussed towards the project goal.           |

## Agile Methodologies - Progress Report
- **Problem**: In Agile, the team focuses on working system and less emphasis on creating documentation
	- Hence when documentation is not up to date, miscommunication appears between systems development team and product owner.
- **Importance**: Agile reports should reflect the daily progress of systems development
- Ways of Agile reporting are:
	- Kanban Boards
	- Burndown Charts

## Product Backlog (DEEP)
- The backlog is a list of user stories that drives the requirements
	- The product owner has the sole authority add or modify the work to the backlog
	- The list get reprioritized with the changes
- Backlog should be **D**etailed, **E**stimated, **E**mergent, and **P**rioritized **DEEP**
- User stories should be **detailed** on the requirements level
	- Requiremnts are **detailed** systems capability needed by the user to solve a problem to achieve an objective Dorfman and Thayer (1990)
