## Design Phase
- Develop a design strategy
	- Implement? Outsource? Buy...
- Design architecture and interfaces
- Develop databases and file specifications
- Develop the program design to specify:
	- What programs to write
	- What each program will do

## Implementation Phase
- Construct the system
	- Build it (Write the programming code)
	- Test it
- Install system
	- Train the users
- Support the system (maintenance)

## Software Development Life Cycle Cont'd
- Process and deliverables

- Triangle is planning
- Diamond is analysis
- Circle is Design
- Square is Implementation

Why build a system?
- Planning phase

What are the requirements?
- Analysis phase
