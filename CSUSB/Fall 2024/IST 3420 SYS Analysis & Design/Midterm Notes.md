- What would the Systems Analysis and Design Course look like?

1. A higher and detailed Analysis and design for a system solving a business problem
    
2. A software engineering course.
    
3. A programming course.

## Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design (Cont’d)
- “Good design go to heaven;
    
bad design goes everywhere” Mieke Gerritzen

- “I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn’t say any other way – things I had no words for”. Georgia

- “When you do something, you should burn yourself up completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.” Shunryu Suzuki

## Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design (Cont’d)
- What is the main reason behind the failure of Systems development:

1. Failure in planning.
    
2. Implementation problems and Lack of technological expertise
    
3. Failure in project management and Systems Analysis and Design

- What is Information Systems?
    
- An information system is an arrangement of people, data, processes, hardware, networks, and software that interact for the purpose 

- Providing business value 

Supporting day-to-day operations and problem solving

- What is a Life Cycle?
- It is a term borrowed from biological/life sciences to depict the different stages that an organism passes through during their lifetime.

## Software Development Life Cycle
- When did Software Development Life Cycle SDLC was first introduced?

- It is a concept introduced in the late 60s.
    
- Why was it introduced?

- Purpose: impose some framework and structure onto the IS development activities.
    
- What is SDLC?
    
- SDLC decomposes the process of IS development into a set of distinct phases.
    
- Each phase involves a set of activities/steps and is to produce a set of deliverables.
![[Pasted image 20241010232851.png]]

- The project was supposed to replace a collection of aging purchasing and procurement systems.
    
- The goal was to eliminate paper, increasing speed and cutting costs. 
    
- Grass root problem: Neither Ford nor Oracle, its partner, is talking, but according to analysts, while cost may have sounded the death knell, the real killers were poor design
    
- Design problem

- Why do we need Systems Analysis and Design?
    
- HP Co, Enterprise Resource Planning ERP System (2004):
    
- Symptom: ERP system problems contribute to $160 million loss reported in third-quarter only due to shortfall within HP's SAP ERP servers and storage
    
- The goal was to successfully implement and migrate a SAP ERP system at HP. 
    
Grass root problem: Failure in project management


- Why do we need Systems Analysis and Design
    
- AT&T Wireless, Customer Relationship Management CRM System (2004):

![[Pasted image 20241010235248.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241010235302.png]]

## Agile Methodologies
- What are Agile methodologies?
    
- A combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working product.
    
- Each iteration deliver a product build (version)
    
- Each increment aims to enhance and improve the previous build.

Extreme programming
![[Pasted image 20241010235420.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241010235429.png]]

## Scrum
- SCRUM
    
- Each iteration is called a sprint could be one week period or more.
    
- All team members gather for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint led by the Scrum Master 
    
- Projects progress via a series of sprints

## SCRUM Core Values

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Core Values|Key Principles|
|Commitment|Sprint, team, and individual based commitments.|
|Courage|Scrum team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.|
|Respect|Scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.|
|Openness|Investigate reality with a specific end goal to make sensible adjustments (reflect on up to date Kanban boards and burndown charts).|
|Focus|Iterative-incremental approach and timely delivery in Scrum helps to keep the team stay focussed towards the project goal.|
## Agile Methodologies - Progress Report
- Problem: In Agile, the team focuses on working system and less emphasis on creating documentation
    
- Hence when documentation is not up to date, miscommunication appears between systems development team and product owner.
    
- Importance: Agile reports should reflect the daily progress of systems development. 
    
- Ways of Agile reporting are:
    
- Kanban boards.
    
- Burndown charts.

## Product Backlog (DEEP)
- The backlog is a list of user stories that drives the requirements. 
    
- The product owner has the sole authority add or modify the work to the backlog. 
    
- The list get reprioritized with the changes. 
    
- Backlog should be Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized DEEP
    
- User stories should be detailed on the requirements level 
    

Requirements are detailed systems capability needed by the user to solve a problem to achieve an objective Dorfman and Thayer (1990)

## SCRUM Team Roles

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Role|Description|
|Product Owner (PO)|- More like the CEO of the product, the stakeholder manager that aligns everybody around the product vision and objectives. Adjust and re-prioritize the backlog to best meet the vision and objectives.|
|Project Manager (PM)|- Project Manager manages a project on a day-to-day basis and is the only one with this day-to-day focus on the project: project timeline, resources, and scope in order to meet requirements.|
|Scrum Master (SM)|- Lead the development team in executing Agile practices (including leading scrum meetings, updating kanban boards and/or burndown charts) to complete the work the PO prioritizes.|
|Development Team|- Front and back end developers who implement and the product.|

## Kanban Boards
- The Kanban is the Japanese word for billboard, and the idea is that all/most tasks are displayed on a board for the team members to see.

- Often the board is broken up into rows and columns; rows of different requirements of the project, and divided up into different columns, such as ‘backlog,’ ‘To Do,’ ‘In Progress,’ ‘Testing,’ and ‘Done.’
    
- The backlog goes to ‘To Do’ when the project is first started, then the team works on certain requirement, moving the block or requirement they are working on to the appropriate column.
    

Kanban could be physical board or using a [software](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trMQQw76BLkCV1tPq8BjTfjVPQOYb7PA/view?usp=sharing).


# 3a. Software Development Methodologies Revision
- Revise SDLC methodologies
    
- Introduce Systems Analysis and Design with Object Oriented Approach
    
- Introduce Team roles & skill sets

## Software Development Cases
- When requirements are unclear:
    
- Users normally need to interact with technology to really understand what a new system can do and how to best apply it to their needs.
    
- When analysts and programmers are not familiar with new technologies:
    
- It is generally only after several months that the developers discover weaknesses in new technologies
    
- **System Reliability:**
    
- For some applications, reliability is truly critical whereas for other applications it is not as important

- **Complex Systems:** 
    
- According to how big and sophisticated the system requirements are, some methodologies work better than the others.
    

- **Short Time Schedules:**
    
- Project team could adjust the functionality in the system based on a specific delivery date,
    

- **Schedule Visibility:**
    
- One of the greatest challenges in systems development is determining whether a project is on schedule.

- Introduction to staffing in a software development project.

## Project Identification
- **System Request:**
    
- A system request documents 
    
- The business reasons for building a system 
    
- The value that the system is expected to provide
    
- I.e., Higher level of why do we need it?

- **System Request:**
    
- Project sponsor
    
- Primary point of contact for the project
    
- Business need
    
- Reason prompting the project
    
- Business requirements
    
- Business capabilities the system will need to have
    
- Business value
    
- Benefits the organization can expect from the project
    
- Special issues
    
- Anything else that should be considered

- **Business Value:**
    
- Tangible Value
    
- Can be quantified and measured easily
    
- Example: 2 percent reduction in operating costs
    
- Intangible Value
    
- Results from an intuitive belief that the system provides important, but hard-to-measure, benefits to the organization
    
- Example: improved customer service

## Feasibility Analysis
- Objective: to guide the organization in determining whether to proceed with a project.
    
- Feasibility analysis includes a:

## Financial Feasibility Analysis
- Project Investment Criteria 
    
- Net present value (NPV)
    
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 
    
- Return on investment
    
- Payback period

## Financial Feasibility Analysis - Time Value of Money
- Money now (PV) = {the value of money now in addition to Interest} (FV)
    
- Simple annual (1-year) interest rate 5%
    
- I.e. FV of 2$ after 2 year would be 2+(2*0.05)+(2*0.05) = 2.2
    
- Compound interest rate 5% After 1 year:
    
- Interest is calculated through a year period or with in a year (semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily periods).
    
- Interest is computed in an accumulated way over periods.
    
- I.e. FV of 2$ for a compound interest after 2 years= 2+(2*0.05)+(2+(2*0.05))*0.05= 
    
2[1+0.05+0.05+(0.05)^2]=2[1+2*0.05+(0.05)^2]

= 2[1+0.05]^2

# Financial Feasibility Example
Students Registration System (in class example)
- A small school who is using paperwork for registering students is planning to develop a new online student registration (enrollment) System SRS in 12 months period.
    
- SRS expected benefits:
    
- The new SRS is expected to increase enrollment and reduce staff salaries.
    
- Assume that the number of students registering at the school is 1,200 per year and on average each pays each 5,000$ per year for tuition. 
    
- Due to the expected increase in outreach through the new web enabled SRS, the school is expected to accomplish a 6%, 7%, and 8% increase in registrations after the next first, second, and third year respectively. 
    
- Also the system will decrease one staff member from the registrar's office with 3,000$ monthly salary each.

- **SRS expected costs:**
    
- The staff required to develop and maintain the system are as follows:
    
- Graphic designers x2
    
- Systems Analyst
    
- Project Manager
    
- Full Stack Developers x3
    
- Maintenance and support x2
    
- Operation Staff x3
    
- A staff salary would be averaging 3,000$ per month 
    
- The system development would require the purchasing 50,000$ of hardware devices and infrastructure and 40,000$ licensing software for each year.
    
- Assume the interest rate is 3%
    
- Staff training will cost 20,000$

- **System Request:**
    
- Who would be the project sponsor?
    
- Why do we need the system?
    
- What would be the functionality?
    
- What would be the expected value?
    
- What special constraints would you foresee?
    

- **Feasibility:**
    

- You are hired to perform a financial feasibility study. Determine if the system would be profitable for the school? If yes,
    
- Determine the breakeven point and Return on Investment.
    
- What about technical and organizational feasibility?


# Project Management and Cost Estimation
- Link information systems to business needs
    
- Review a system request and system feasibility
    
- Review Feasibility analysis
- Project sponsor (Project Champion)
    
- Business need (Reason prompting the project)
    
- Business requirements (Business capabilities the system will need to have)
    
- Business value (Benefits the organization can expect from the project)
    
- Special issues

## Lesson Objective
- Introduce how to select a project
    
- Introduce project management and cost estimation for software development projects. 
    
- Introduce the different quantitative measures for productivity in software development projects.
    
- Lines of code
    
- Function points
    
- Study the relationship between costing and pricing

## Project Selection
- **Project portfolio management**
    
- A process that optimizes project selection and sequencing in order to best support business goals
    
- Business goals are expressed in terms of
    
- Quantitative economic measures
    
- Business strategy goals
    
- IT strategy goals
    
- Once selected, projects enter the project management process

- **How to select a project**
    
- A recent analysis found that between 2% and 15% of projects taken on by IT departments are not strategic to the business.
    
- Being aligned with the overarching business strategy and add business value
    
- A project that solves the grass roots business problem and not the symptoms of the problem.

- **How not to select a project**
    
- First in, first out
    
- Political clout of project inventor
    
- Squeaky wheel getting the grease
    
- Any other method that does not involve a deliberate course of action analysis

## Project Management
- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service.
    
- Examples:
    
- Developing a new product or service
    
- Constructing a building or facility

## Project Management in Software Development
- Project Management is the process of planning and controlling system development within a specified time at a minimum cost with the right functionality
    
- **Project management processes are:**
    
- Initiation
    
- Planning
    
- Execution
    
- Control
    
- Termination

## Project Management
- Will the customer want feature X
    
- e.g., creating tables for a word processor, or merging documents?
    
- Cheap or expensive version feature X?
    
- If you implement the cheap version of feature X, will the customer later want the expensive version?
    
- How will feature X be designed? 
    
- How long will it take to debug and correct mistakes made in the implementation of feature X?
    
- How long will it take to integrate feature X with all other features?

## Project Effort Estimation
- What is the total cost of an activity
    
- How much effort is required to complete an activity?
    
- How much calendar time is needed to complete an activity?
    
- **Estimation techniques:**
    
- Software productivity
    
- Estimation techniques
    
- Costing and pricing

- Estimation involves trade-offs between functionality, time and cost
    
- It is the process of assigning projected values for time and effort
    
- **Function point method is based on:**
    
- Technical complexity factors 
    
- Environmental factors 
    
- Most accurate estimates come from experience

- **Why is project estimation difficult?**
    
- Constructing a software is like constructing a house: you cannot tell how much it is going to cost until you know exactly what “it” is.
    
- However, software is an intangible product
    
- Until each feature is understood in detail, you cannot estimate the cost precisely (McConnell 1996).
    
- Software development is a process of gradual refinement, i.e.,at the beginning some imprecision is unavoidable.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Size related measures based on some output from the software process. This may be:
    
- Lines of delivered source code
    
- Object code instructions, etc.
    
- Function-related measures based on an estimate of the functionality of the delivered software. 
    
- Function-points are the best known of this type of measure.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code (size-related measure)
    
- The measure was first proposed when programs were typed on cards with one line per card;
    
- The lower level the language, the more productive the programmer
    
- How does this correspond to statements as in Java which can span several lines or where there can be several statements on one line.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code
![[Pasted image 20241011004956.png]]

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code
    
- The same functionality takes more code to implement in a lower-level language than in a high-level language.
    
- The more verbose the programmer, the higher the productivity
    
- Measures of productivity based on lines of code suggest that programmers who write verbose code are more productive than programmers who write compact code.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- A measure of the rate at which individual engineers involved in software development produce software and associated  
    documentation of their work.
    
- Essentially, we want to measure useful functionality produced per time unit.
    
- Problem: 
    
- Quality assurance is a factor in productivity assessment.
    
- It is hard to measure quality-oriented productivity measures, productivity is more measured quantitatively.

- **Quality and productivity**
    
- All metrics based on volume/unit time are somehow flawed because they do not take quality into Account.
    
- Productivity may generally be increased at the cost of quality.
    
- If requirements are constantly changing then an approach based on counting lines of code is not meaningful as the program itself is not static;
    
- What would be important is how fast, the team could respond with high-quality deliverables to change requests?
