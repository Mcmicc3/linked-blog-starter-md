- “Good design go to heaven;
    
bad design goes everywhere” Mieke Gerritzen

- “I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn’t say any other way – things I had no words for”. Georgia

- “When you do something, you should burn yourself up completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.” Shunryu Suzuki

## Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design (Cont’d)
- What is the main reason behind the failure of Systems development:

1. Failure in planning.
    
2. Implementation problems and Lack of technological expertise
    
3. Failure in project management and Systems Analysis and Design

- What is Information Systems?
    
- An information system is an arrangement of people, data, processes, hardware, networks, and software that interact for the purpose 

- Providing business value 

Supporting day-to-day operations and problem solving

- What is a Life Cycle?
- It is a term borrowed from biological/life sciences to depict the different stages that an organism passes through during their lifetime.

## Software Development Life Cycle
- When did Software Development Life Cycle SDLC was first introduced?

- It is a concept introduced in the late 60s.
    
- Why was it introduced?

- Purpose: impose some framework and structure onto the IS development activities.
    
- What is SDLC?
    
- SDLC decomposes the process of IS development into a set of distinct phases.
    
- Each phase involves a set of activities/steps and is to produce a set of deliverables.

- The project was supposed to replace a collection of aging purchasing and procurement systems.
    
- The goal was to eliminate paper, increasing speed and cutting costs. 
    
- Grass root problem: Neither Ford nor Oracle, its partner, is talking, but according to analysts, while cost may have sounded the death knell, the real killers were poor design
    
- Design problem

- Why do we need Systems Analysis and Design?
    
- HP Co, Enterprise Resource Planning ERP System (2004):
    
- Symptom: ERP system problems contribute to $160 million loss reported in third-quarter only due to shortfall within HP's SAP ERP servers and storage
    
- The goal was to successfully implement and migrate a SAP ERP system at HP. 
    
Grass root problem: Failure in project management

![[Pasted image 20241010235248.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241010235302.png]]

## Agile Methodologies
- What are Agile methodologies?
    
- A combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working product.
    
- Each iteration deliver a product build (version)
    
- Each increment aims to enhance and improve the previous build.

Extreme programming
![[Pasted image 20241010235420.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241010235429.png]]

## Scrum
- SCRUM
    
- Each iteration is called a sprint could be one week period or more.
    
- All team members gather for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint led by the Scrum Master 
    
- Projects progress via a series of sprints

## SCRUM Core Values

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Core Values|Key Principles|
|Commitment|Sprint, team, and individual based commitments.|
|Courage|Scrum team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.|
|Respect|Scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.|
|Openness|Investigate reality with a specific end goal to make sensible adjustments (reflect on up to date Kanban boards and burndown charts).|
|Focus|Iterative-incremental approach and timely delivery in Scrum helps to keep the team stay focussed towards the project goal.|
## Agile Methodologies - Progress Report
- Problem: In Agile, the team focuses on working system and less emphasis on creating documentation
    
- Hence when documentation is not up to date, miscommunication appears between systems development team and product owner.
    
- Importance: Agile reports should reflect the daily progress of systems development. 
    
- Ways of Agile reporting are:
    
- Kanban boards.
    
- Burndown charts.

## Product Backlog (DEEP)
- The backlog is a list of user stories that drives the requirements. 
    
- The product owner has the sole authority add or modify the work to the backlog. 
    
- The list get reprioritized with the changes. 
    
- Backlog should be Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized DEEP
    
- User stories should be detailed on the requirements level 
    

Requirements are detailed systems capability needed by the user to solve a problem to achieve an objective Dorfman and Thayer (1990)

## SCRUM Team Roles

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Role|Description|
|Product Owner (PO)|- More like the CEO of the product, the stakeholder manager that aligns everybody around the product vision and objectives. Adjust and re-prioritize the backlog to best meet the vision and objectives.|
|Project Manager (PM)|- Project Manager manages a project on a day-to-day basis and is the only one with this day-to-day focus on the project: project timeline, resources, and scope in order to meet requirements.|
|Scrum Master (SM)|- Lead the development team in executing Agile practices (including leading scrum meetings, updating kanban boards and/or burndown charts) to complete the work the PO prioritizes.|
|Development Team|- Front and back end developers who implement and the product.|

## Kanban Boards
- The Kanban is the Japanese word for billboard, and the idea is that all/most tasks are displayed on a board for the team members to see.

- Often the board is broken up into rows and columns; rows of different requirements of the project, and divided up into different columns, such as ‘backlog,’ ‘To Do,’ ‘In Progress,’ ‘Testing,’ and ‘Done.’
    
- The backlog goes to ‘To Do’ when the project is first started, then the team works on certain requirement, moving the block or requirement they are working on to the appropriate column.
    

Kanban could be physical board or using a [software](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trMQQw76BLkCV1tPq8BjTfjVPQOYb7PA/view?usp=sharing).


# 3a. Software Development Methodologies Revision
- Revise SDLC methodologies
    
- Introduce Systems Analysis and Design with Object Oriented Approach
    
- Introduce Team roles & skill sets

## Software Development Cases
- When requirements are unclear:
    
- Users normally need to interact with technology to really understand what a new system can do and how to best apply it to their needs.
    
- When analysts and programmers are not familiar with new technologies:
    
- It is generally only after several months that the developers discover weaknesses in new technologies
    
- **System Reliability:**
    
- For some applications, reliability is truly critical whereas for other applications it is not as important

- **Complex Systems:** 
    
- According to how big and sophisticated the system requirements are, some methodologies work better than the others.
    

- **Short Time Schedules:**
    
- Project team could adjust the functionality in the system based on a specific delivery date,
    

- **Schedule Visibility:**
    
- One of the greatest challenges in systems development is determining whether a project is on schedule.

## Project Identification
- **System Request:**
    
- A system request documents 
    
- The business reasons for building a system 
    
- The value that the system is expected to provide
    
- I.e., Higher level of why do we need it?

- **System Request:**
    
- Project sponsor
    
- Primary point of contact for the project
    
- Business need
    
- Reason prompting the project

- Business capabilities the system will need to have
    
- Business value
    
- Benefits the organization can expect from the project
    
- Special issues
    
- Anything else that should be considered

- **Business Value:**
    
- Tangible Value
    
- Can be quantified and measured easily
    
- Example: 2 percent reduction in operating costs
    
- Intangible Value
    
- Results from an intuitive belief that the system provides important, but hard-to-measure, benefits to the organization
    
- Example: improved customer service

## Feasibility Analysis
- Objective: to guide the organization in determining whether to proceed with a project.
    
- Feasibility analysis includes a:

## Financial Feasibility Analysis
- Project Investment Criteria 
    
- Net present value (NPV)
    
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 
    
- Return on investment
    
- Payback period

## Financial Feasibility Analysis - Time Value of Money
- Money now (PV) = {the value of money now in addition to Interest} (FV)
    
- Simple annual (1-year) interest rate 5%
    
- I.e. FV of 2$ after 2 year would be 2+(2*0.05)+(2*0.05) = 2.2
    
- Compound interest rate 5% After 1 year:
    
- Interest is calculated through a year period or with in a year (semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily periods).
    
- Interest is computed in an accumulated way over periods.
    
- I.e. FV of 2$ for a compound interest after 2 years= 2+(2*0.05)+(2+(2*0.05))*0.05= 
    
2[1+0.05+0.05+(0.05)^2]=2[1+2*0.05+(0.05)^2]

= 2[1+0.05]^2

# Financial Feasibility Example
Students Registration System (in class example)
- A small school who is using paperwork for registering students is planning to develop a new online student registration (enrollment) System SRS in 12 months period.
    
- SRS expected benefits:
    
- The new SRS is expected to increase enrollment and reduce staff salaries.
    
- Assume that the number of students registering at the school is 1,200 per year and on average each pays each 5,000$ per year for tuition. 
    
- Due to the expected increase in outreach through the new web enabled SRS, the school is expected to accomplish a 6%, 7%, and 8% increase in registrations after the next first, second, and third year respectively. 
    
- Also the system will decrease one staff member from the registrar's office with 3,000$ monthly salary each.

- **SRS expected costs:**
    
- The staff required to develop and maintain the system are as follows:
    
- Graphic designers x2
    
- Systems Analyst
    
- Project Manager
    
- Full Stack Developers x3
    
- Maintenance and support x2
    
- Operation Staff x3
    
- A staff salary would be averaging 3,000$ per month 
    
- The system development would require the purchasing 50,000$ of hardware devices and infrastructure and 40,000$ licensing software for each year.
    
- Assume the interest rate is 3%
    
- Staff training will cost 20,000$

- **System Request:**
    
- Who would be the project sponsor?
    
- Why do we need the system?
    
- What would be the functionality?
    
- What would be the expected value?
    
- What special constraints would you foresee?
    

- **Feasibility:**
    

- You are hired to perform a financial feasibility study. Determine if the system would be profitable for the school? If yes,
    
- Determine the breakeven point and Return on Investment.
    
- What about technical and organizational feasibility?


# Project Management and Cost Estimation
- Link information systems to business needs
    
- Review a system request and system feasibility
    
- Review Feasibility analysis
- Project sponsor (Project Champion)
    
- Business need (Reason prompting the project)
    
- Business requirements (Business capabilities the system will need to have)
    
- Business value (Benefits the organization can expect from the project)
    
- Special issues

## Lesson Objective
- Introduce how to select a project
    
- Introduce project management and cost estimation for software development projects. 
    
- Introduce the different quantitative measures for productivity in software development projects.
    
- Lines of code
    
- Function points
    
- Study the relationship between costing and pricing

## Project Selection
- **Project portfolio management**
    
- A process that optimizes project selection and sequencing in order to best support business goals
    
- Business goals are expressed in terms of
    
- Quantitative economic measures
    
- Business strategy goals
    
- IT strategy goals
    
- Once selected, projects enter the project management process

- **How to select a project**
    
- A recent analysis found that between 2% and 15% of projects taken on by IT departments are not strategic to the business.
    
- Being aligned with the overarching business strategy and add business value
    
- A project that solves the grass roots business problem and not the symptoms of the problem.

- **How not to select a project**
    
- First in, first out
    
- Political clout of project inventor
    
- Squeaky wheel getting the grease
    
- Any other method that does not involve a deliberate course of action analysis

## Project Management
- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service.
    
- Examples:
    
- Developing a new product or service
    
- Constructing a building or facility

## Project Management in Software Development
- Project Management is the process of planning and controlling system development within a specified time at a minimum cost with the right functionality
    
- **Project management processes are:**
    
- Initiation
    
- Planning
    
- Execution
    
- Control
    
- Termination

## Project Management
- Will the customer want feature X
    
- e.g., creating tables for a word processor, or merging documents?
    
- Cheap or expensive version feature X?
    
- If you implement the cheap version of feature X, will the customer later want the expensive version?
    
- How will feature X be designed? 
    
- How long will it take to debug and correct mistakes made in the implementation of feature X?
    
- How long will it take to integrate feature X with all other features?

## Project Effort Estimation
- What is the total cost of an activity
    
- How much effort is required to complete an activity?
    
- How much calendar time is needed to complete an activity?
    
- **Estimation techniques:**
    
- Software productivity
    
- Estimation techniques
    
- Costing and pricing

- Estimation involves trade-offs between functionality, time and cost
    
- It is the process of assigning projected values for time and effort
    
- **Function point method is based on:**
    
- Technical complexity factors 
    
- Environmental factors 
    
- Most accurate estimates come from experience

- **Why is project estimation difficult?**
    
- Constructing a software is like constructing a house: you cannot tell how much it is going to cost until you know exactly what “it” is.
    
- However, software is an intangible product
    
- Until each feature is understood in detail, you cannot estimate the cost precisely (McConnell 1996).
    
- Software development is a process of gradual refinement, i.e.,at the beginning some imprecision is unavoidable.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Size related measures based on some output from the software process. This may be:
    
- Lines of delivered source code
    
- Object code instructions, etc.
    
- Function-related measures based on an estimate of the functionality of the delivered software. 
    
- Function-points are the best known of this type of measure.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code (size-related measure)
    
- The measure was first proposed when programs were typed on cards with one line per card;
    
- The lower level the language, the more productive the programmer
    
- How does this correspond to statements as in Java which can span several lines or where there can be several statements on one line.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code
![[Pasted image 20241011004956.png]]

- **Software Productivity**
    
- Lines of code
    
- The same functionality takes more code to implement in a lower-level language than in a high-level language.
    
- The more verbose the programmer, the higher the productivity
    
- Measures of productivity based on lines of code suggest that programmers who write verbose code are more productive than programmers who write compact code.

- **Software Productivity**
    
- A measure of the rate at which individual engineers involved in software development produce software and associated  
    documentation of their work.
    
- Essentially, we want to measure useful functionality produced per time unit.
    
- Problem: 
    
- Quality assurance is a factor in productivity assessment.
    
- It is hard to measure quality-oriented productivity measures, productivity is more measured quantitatively.

- **Quality and productivity**
    
- All metrics based on volume/unit time are somehow flawed because they do not take quality into Account.
    
- Productivity may generally be increased at the cost of quality.
    
- If requirements are constantly changing then an approach based on counting lines of code is not meaningful as the program itself is not static;
    
- What would be important is how fast, the team could respond with high-quality deliverables to change requests?

# Cost Estimation Techniques
## Estimation Techniques
![[Pasted image 20241021224006.png]]
algorithmic cost modelling, expert judgement, estimation by analogy, parkinson's law, pricing to win. 
- **Top-down estimation**
    
- Start with estimating the primary tasks and then drill down to more detailed tasks.
    
- Takes into account costs such as integration, configuration management and documentation.
    
- Usable when the system technology, and the components that might be part of the system details is not yet known.
    
- Can underestimate the cost of solving difficult low-level technical problems.


- **Bottom-up estimation**
    
- Start with estimating the more detailed tasks, then aggregating to the primary tasks.
    
- Usable when the technology for developing the system is known and components are identified.
    
- This can be an accurate method if the system has been designed in detail.
    
- It may underestimate the costs of system level activities such as integration and documentation.

## Project Effort Estimation (Cont’d)
- Factors affecting productivity
![[Pasted image 20241021224211.png]]
Application domain experience, process quality, project size, technology support, working environment. 

## Estimation Techniques (Cont’d)
- **Factors Influencing the Estimation** 
    
- The size of a software system can only be known accurately when it is finished.
    
- Several factors influence the final size
    
- Use of COTS Components Of The Shelve;
    
- Programming language;
    
- Distribution of system.
    
- As the development process progresses then the size estimate becomes more accurate.

## Project Effort Estimation (Cont’d)
- **Function points**
    
- Based on a combination of program characteristics
    
- External inputs and outputs;
    
- Number of transactions and queries;
    
- External interfaces;
    
- Files used by the system.
    
- A weight is associated with each of these function point count is computed by multiplying each raw count by the weight and summing all values.

- **Function points estimation**
    
- Actors & Use-cases:

- **Function points estimation**
    
- Technical complexity factors:
![[Pasted image 20241021224532.png]]

- Environment factor ECF:
![[Pasted image 20241021224555.png]]

- Person-hours Multiplier PHM :
![[Pasted image 20241021224620.png]]

- Factors influencing pricing
![[Pasted image 20241021224651.png]]
Market opportunity, cost estimate uncertainty, contractual terms, requirements volatility, financial health. 

## Estimation Techniques (Cont’d)
- **Estimation accuracy**
    
- There is no simple way to make an accurate estimate of the effort required to develop a software system
    
- Initial estimates are based on uncertain information in an early user requirements gathering phase;
    
- The software may run on unfamiliar computers or use new technology;
    
- The people in the project may be unknown.
    
- The estimate defines the budget and the product is adjusted to meet the budget.


- **Estimation accuracy** 
    
- Judgment based Vs. Model based estimations
    
- Each method has strengths and weaknesses.
    
- Estimation should be based on several methods.
    
- If these do not return approximately the same result, then you have insufficient information available to make an estimate.
    
- Some action should be taken to find out more in order to make more accurate estimates.

## Costing and Pricing
- Estimates are made to discover the cost to the development for producing a software system.
    
- There is not a simple relationship between the development cost and the price charged to the customer.
    
- Broader organizational, economic, political and business considerations influence the price charged.


# Scope Management
## Scope Management (Cont’d)
- **Scope “creep”** 
    
- Sometimes a requirement could be missed at the beginning and are discovered late.
    
- Scope creep results from adding new requirements to the project at a later stage after finishing analysis.
    
- Project Manager is responsible to manage changes to reduce scope creep
    
- Can have a huge effect on the schedule
    
- If needs are fuzzy what would be a good software development methodology to use?


- **Techniques to manage the project scope:**
    
- Identify all requirements at the outset (if possible)
    
- Adopt an agile development methodology 
    
- Allow only those changes deemed absolutely necessary (Bare minimum)
    
- Carefully examine the impact of suggested changes
    
- Delay some changes for “future enhancements”


- **Techniques to manage the project scope:**
    
- Time boxing
    
- Allocate time frame for a software development process even if it implies that not all features will be met. 
    
- 80% of features takes 20% of project schedule, and 20% of the features takes 80% of the project schedule
    
- I.e. Word Processor 
    
- File merging Vs. Font styling

## Staffing the project
- **Goals**:
    
- Determine how many people are required
    
- Match skill sets to required activities
    
- Motivate the team to meet the objectives
    
- Minimize conflicts


- **Deliverable—The staffing plan, which includes:**
    
- Number & kind of people assigned
    
- Overall reporting structure
    
- The project charter (describes the project’s objectives and rules)
    
- What would happen if team members do not know the reporting structure? What would happen if they are not aware with the strategic goals?

- **Project Charter**
![[Pasted image 20241021225402.png]]

- **Calculate the number of people needed:**
    
![[Pasted image 20241021225426.png]]
- Overhead should be added as a slack to the above equation
    
- Create a reporting structure for large projects
    
- Form sub-teams as necessary (1:8-10)
    
- Assign the Project Manager, Functional lead & Technical lead
    
- Pay attention to technical and interpersonal skills

- **Choose the right people onboard according to their skill set**
    
- Always support the team to progress and meet goals:
    
- Monetary rewards makes your team happy
    
- Motivation is the have a great influence on performance
    
Which is more influential to your team moral and progress monetary rewards or motivation?

## Always Keep Motivating (Cont’d)
- 20% time-off rule 
    
- Allow members to focus on what interests them in their job
    
- Peer-to-peer recognition awards
    
- Team ownership (refer to the team as “we”)
    
- Utilize equitable compensation
    
- Encourage group ownership
    
- Provide self government, but trust the team to deliver

## Conflict Management
- **Preventing or mitigating conflict:**
    
- Clearly define plans for the project
    
- Cohesiveness has the greatest effect
    
- Clearly defining roles and holding team members accountable
    
- Develop a project charter
    
- Establish work & communications rules in the project charter


- **Additional techniques:**
    
- Make sure the team understands the importance of the project
    
- Develop detailed operating procedures
    
- Develop a schedule of commitments in advance
    
- Forecast other priorities and their impact on the project

## Work Hard to Acquire a Jelled Team (Cont’d)
- A team of people so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
    
- **Characteristics of a jelled team:**
    
- Very low turnover rate
    
- Strong sense of identity
    
- A feeling of eliteness
    
- Team vs. individual ownership of the project
    
- Team members enjoy their work

## Social Engineering for Project Managers
- Situational leadership 
    
- There is no single "best" style of leadership.
    


- **Emotional Intelligence** 
    
- Is the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others and use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to take advantage and be time responsive of this important aspect to achieving the project's goal(s).

- **Neuro-Linguistic Programming**
    
- connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals
    
- Social Engineering
    
- Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions.
    
- Be aware: Could be used for bad intentions too.


- **What would be good resources for developing leadership skills for a successful project manager?**
    
- Harvard Business Review
    
- Dale Carnegie “How to win friends and Influence people” and course.
    
- Warren Buffet used these resources [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucD7fVZ7W3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucD7fVZ7W3k) 
    
- “Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking” by Christopher Hadnagy

## Lesson Objectives
- **What is requirements engineering?**
    
- What are Requirements
    
- Types of requirements
    
- Levels of requirements

## Requirements Definition
- “The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build.
    
- No other part of the conceptual work is as difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements.

- Includes all the interfaces to people, to machines, and to other software systems. 

- No other part of the work cripples the resulting system if done Wrong.

- “No other part is more difficult to rectify later” Brooks (1987)

## Introduction
- **The systems development process transforms the existing (as is) system into the proposed (to be) system**
    
- Requirements determination
    
- The single most critical step of the entire SDLC
    
- Changes can be made easily in this stage
    
- Most (>50%) system failures are due to problems with requirements

- **Following the Unified Process Methodology:**
    
- The iterative process of OOSAD is effective because:
    
- Small batches of requirements can be identified and implemented incrementally 
    
- The system will evolve over time
    
- Requirements Engineering: process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process

## Requirement Engineering
- **Requirements development**
    
- Elicitation, specification and validation of requirements
    
- Requirements management
    
- Establishing and managing an agreement with the customer (Paulk et al., 1995)
    
- This classification is not universal.
    
- Some people use “requirements management” to refer to the entire field of requirements engineering

## Requirement Determination
- **Purpose: to convert high level business requirements (from the system request) into detailed requirements that can be used as inputs for creating models**
    
- What is a requirement?
    
- A statement of what the system must do as a capability or a characteristic it must have
    
- Will later evolve into a technical description of how the system will be implemented (design)

## More Definitions for Software Requirements
- **Dorfman and Thayer (1990):**
    
- A software capability needed by the user to solve a business problem to achieve an objective (functional requirements)
    
A software characteristic that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documentation (nonfunctional requirements)

- **Sommerville and Sawyer (1997):**
    
- Requirement is a specification of what should be implemented. 
    
- A description of what the system should do, or of a system property or attribute. 
    
- They may be a constraint on the development process of the system.

## Requirements Definition
- **Functional & non-functional requirements listed in outline format**
    
- Prioritized
    
- Provides information needed in subsequent workflows
    
- Defines the scope of the system

- **According to the Standish Group survey for the most common factors in challenged products:**
    
- 13% reported “lack of user input”
    
- 12% reported “incomplete requirements and specification”
    
- Rework can consume 30 to 50% of total development cost (Boehm and Papaccio, 1988)

- **What requirements is**
    
- A statement of what the system must do
    
- A statement of characteristics the system must have
    
- …to satisfy a user need.

- **What requirements are not**
    
- Project-related information such as schedules, budgets, configuration management plans,…etc.
    
- Design or implementation details
    
- Testing information
    
- “Simply, what we need to focus on what we intend to build for the user”

## Types of Requirements
- **Functional requirements** 
    
- What will the system do?
    
- Action-oriented: Expresses what the system should do and describe its behavior. (Use case driven)
    
- Non-functional requirements 
    
- What are the characteristics of the system?
    
- Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Supportability

## Functional Requirements
- **Form the behavior of the product or system**
    
- New behaviors
    
- New features
    
- Bug fixes related to improving behavior

## Non Functional Requirements
- **Implicit expectations from the product or system**
    
- These are expected features and not specifically documented requirements
    
- They are also known as quality attributes
    
- For example: responsiveness and developing a website (response time)

## Types of Requirements
- **Non-functional: relates to performance or usability**
    
- Internal:
    
- Maintainability, portability, reusability, and testability.
    
- External:
    
- Efficiency, reliability, and usability (ease of use)
    
- Caution should not drive scope creep

- **For an information system to be successful, the system must not only meet the functional specification,** 
    
- But it must also meet the external nonfunctional specifications.
    
- Design constraints
    
- A restriction on the design of the system that must be fulfilled to meet technical, business, or behavioral obligations.

## Hospital Management System HMS Example
- **Functional**:
    
- Patient manages appointment 
    
- Receptionist prints schedule and cancel appointment 
    
- Doctor updates schedule

- **Non-functional: relates to performance or usability**
    
- Operational requirements:
    
- The system will operate in Windows Environment 
    
- The system should be able to connect to printers wirelessly
    
- System should automatically backup data each day at midnight.

## Types of Requirements
- **Non-functional: relates to performance or usability**
    
- Performance requirements:
    
- The system should respond to any request in less that 2 seconds
    
- Security requirements
    
- Doctors should be the only ones to login with strong passwords to set their availabilities.
    
- Cultural and political issues
    
- All web pages should be localized in both Spanish and English



# Requirements Analysis Strategies
## Types of Requirements (revision)
- **Functional requirements** 
    
- What will the system do?
    
- Action-oriented: Expresses how the system behaves
    
- Non-functional requirements 
    
- What are the characteristics of the system?
    
- Usability
    
- Reliability
    
- Performance
    
- Supportability

## Objectives
- Introduction to Analysis Strategies
    
- Introduce Requirements Analysis techniques 
    
- Introduce customer bill of rights and responsibilities
    
- Hierarchy of needs, features, and requirements.
    
- Learn about eliciting requirements and documenting requirements
    
- Introduce common pitfalls in requirements analysis

## Requirements Analysis Strategies
- **Problem analysis (Get a better understanding)**
    
- Ask users to identify problems with the current system
    
- Ask users how they would solve these problems
    
- Good for improving efficiency or ease-of-use

- **Duration analysis**
    
- Determine the time required to complete each step in a business process
    
- Compare this to the total time required for the entire process
    
- Large differences suggest problems that might be solved by:
    
- Integrating some steps together
    
- Performing some steps simultaneously (in parallel)
    
- Example:
    
- System’s mortgage request approval taking longer than expected. (e.g., data entry, credit check, title search, appraisal, manager approval)

- **Activity-based costing** 
    
- Same as duration analysis but applied to costs
    
- Hourly rate spent on the input such the hourly cost of the staff.
    
- Indirect cost allocated on tasks
    
- If a process is consuming more money than it should, then there is a problem

- **Outcome analysis** 
    
- Understanding the fundamental outcomes that provide value to customers. 
    
- Managers and project sponsor put themselves in customers shoes
    
- What does the customer want in the end?
    

- **Informal benchmarking** 
    
- Analyzes similar processes in other successful organizations
    
- How to perform a business process?

- **Technology analysis** 
    
- List important and interesting technologies. 
    
- Systematically identifies how every technology could be applied to the business process and identifies how the business would benefit.
    
- Apply new technologies to business processes & identify benefits
    

- **Activity elimination**
    
- Identify each activity in the business process, and how the function could operate without it.
    
- Eliminate each activity in a business process in a “force-fit” exercise


- **Root cause analysis (Analyze the right problem)**
    
- Focus is on the cause of a problem, not its solution
    
- Create a prioritized list of problems
    
- Try to determine their causes
    
- Once the causes are known, solutions can be developed

## Levels of Requirements
- Needs
    
- A reflection of the business, personal, or operational problem (or opportunity) that must be addressed in order to justify consideration, purchase, or use of a new system (Leffingwell and Widrig, 2000)
    
- Examples
    
- I need an easier way to track defects in software projects.

- **Features**
    
- A service the system provides to fulfill one or more stakeholder needs. (Leffingwell and Widrig, 2000)
    
- Examples
    
- The defect tracking system will provide trending information to help the user assess Project status.

- **Requirements Dorfman and Thayer (1990):**
    
- A detailed software capability needed by the user to solve a problem to achieve an objective
    
A software characteristic that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract specification, or other formally imposed documentation


- **Requirements**
    
- Examples
    
- Trending information will be provided in a histogram report showing time on the x-axis and the number of defects found on the y-axis
    
- The user can enter the trending period in units of days, weeks, or months.
    
- An example trend report is shown in Figure XX.

## Consumer Bill of Rights
- **Expect analysts to speak your language.**
    
- Expect analysts to learn about your business and your objectives for the system.
    
- Expect analysts to structure the information you present during requirements elicitation into a written software requirements specification.
    
- Have analysts explain all work products created from the requirements process.
    
- Expect analysts and developers to treat you with respect and to maintain a collaborative and professional attitude.


- **Educate analysts and developers about your business and define business jargon.**
    
- Spend the time that it takes to provide requirements, clarify them, and iteratively flesh them out.
    
- Be specific and precise when providing input about the system's requirements.
    
- Make timely decisions about requirements when requested to do so.
    
- Respect a developer's assessment of the cost and feasibility of requirements.

- **In collaboration with the developers, set priorities for functional requirements, system features, or use cases.**
    
- Review requirements documents and evaluate prototypes.
    
- Communicate changes to the requirements as soon as you know about them.
    
- Follow the development organization's process for requesting requirements changes.
    
- Respect the processes the analysts use for requirements engineering.

## Analysis Pitfalls (Standish Report)
- Insufficient user involvement
    
- Creeping user requirements
    
- Ambiguous requirements
    
- Gold plating
    
- Minimal specification
    
- Overlooked user stakeholders
    
- Analysis paralysis

- A set of written questions used to obtain information from individuals
    

  

- May be paper based or electronic (e.g., web based)
    

  

- Common uses:
    

  

- Large numbers of people 
    

  

- Need both information and opinions 
    

  

- When designing for use outside the organization (customers, vendors, etc.)
    

  

- Typical response rates: < 50% (paper); < 30% (Web)

- Select the participants

- Review typical user documents:
    

  

- Forms
    

  

- Reports
    

  

- Policy manuals
    

  

- Look for user additions to forms
    

  

- Look for unused form elements

- Users/managers often don’t remember everything they do
    

  

- Behaviors may change when people are watched
    

  

- Workers tend to be very careful when watched
    

  

- Keep a low profile
    

  

- Try not to interrupt or influence workers
    

  

- Be careful not to ignore periodic activities
    

  

- Weekly … Monthly … Annually

- Checks validity of information gathered through a combination of techniques
    
- Document analysis & observation require little training; JAD sessions can be very challenging

![[Pasted image 20241022005423.png]]

- Focus groups and workshops: Interviews tend to be one on one, and elicit only one person’s perspective. Also, it can be very revealing to get a group of stakeholders together to discuss issues and requirements like JAD. 
    

  

- In observations, spend time with stakeholders in their day-to-day tasks, and in seasonal activities.
    

- Good for understanding the nature and context of the tasks, but, it requires time and commitment
    

  

-  It can be very difficult for humans to have a perfectly passive observation.

- Associated with agile development methods
    

  

- Very low tech, easily updatable, and very portable
    

  

- For functional and nonfunctional requirements
    

  

- How to write user stories
    

  

- As a role the author represents
    

  

- I/we can do or have something with these qualities
    

  
To achieve my goal or objective

- User stories (One user story per requirement):
    

  

- Patient manages appointment 
    

  

- Receptionist prints schedule and cancel appointment 
    

  

- Doctor updates schedule

- Each requirement (user story) is discussed
    

  

- How much effort is required to implement it

# Use Case Diagram and Functional Modeling
- **Identify business processes and use cases.**
    
- Create use-case diagrams
    
- Introduce activity diagrams.
    
- Create use case descriptions.
    
- Introduce the rules and style guidelines for use case descriptions.
    
- Create functional models of business processes using use-case diagrams, activity diagrams, and use case descriptions.

## Functional Modeling

- **Use Cases (What? And Why)**
    
- A use case describes the system’s behavior under various conditions as the system responds to a request from one of the stakeholders, called the primary actor (Cockburn 2001)
    
- Request from primary actor
    
- Change in the internal state of the system
    
- Response from the system


- **Why study use cases?**
    
- Describes what the system will do, revealing its scope, i.e., its purpose in life.
    
- A basis for negotiation.
    
- A basis for cost and schedule estimation
    
- Uncover surprises and missing requirements
    
- Brainstorming of what can go wrong
    
- A basis for other analysis and design artifacts.


- **Use case diagram**
    
- Elements of a use case diagram
    
- Steps for creating use case diagram
    
- Use case description
    
- Elements of a use case
    
- Steps for creating use cases
    
- Alternative approaches to describing use cases
    
- Activity diagrams


- **Now begin the process of turning the requirements into functional models**
    
- Models are logical; i.e., independent of how they are implemented (manual or computerized)
    
- Develop use-cases from the requirements
    
- Use-case: how a business system interacts with its environment
    
- Includes a diagram and a description to depict the discrete activities that the users perform
    
- Develop use case text scenarios and/or activity diagrams from the use-cases
    
- These model the business processes or how a business operates
    
- Used to illustrate the movement of objects (data) between activities

# Use Case Guidelines
## Use cases as a contract for behavior
- **The use case as a contract of behavior captures all and only the behaviors related to satisfying the stakeholders interests and goals**
    
- Actors have goals.
    
- Stakeholders have interests.
    
- Goals can fail.
    

- A use case collects scenarios and can be represented in:
    
- Text description
    
- Activity diagrams
    
- Flow charts 
    
- Programming language
    

- They are requirements (but not all of it)

## Use Case Diagrams
- **Elements of Use-Case Diagrams**
    
- An include relationship: Represents the inclusion of the functionality of one use case within another
    
- An extend relationship: Represents the extension of the use case as an optional behavior other than the main success scenario from the extended use case to the base use case.

## Use Case Relationships
- **Association**
    
- Indicates communication between an actor and a use case.

- The direction does NOT indicate the direction of flow of data.


- **Include relationship**
    
- When to factor out a sub-function and use the include relationship:
    
- The functionality is repeated.
    
- To simplify the use case.
    
- In the base use case description, underline (hyperlink) the included use case.


- **Extend relationship**
    
- Use the extend relationship when:
    
- To add extensions to a use case AND 
    
- The use case’s text is too complex to append or modify

## Identifying Major Use-Cases
- **Review the requirements definition**
    
- Identify the primary actors and their goals
    
- Identify the subject’s boundaries
    
- Identify the business processes and major use-cases
    
- Carefully review the current set of use-cases
    
- Split or combine some to create the right size
    
- Identify additional use-cases

## Create a Use-Case Diagram
- **Place use cases on the diagram**
    
- Place actors on the diagram
    
- Conclude by connecting actors to use cases by lines
    
- Place & draw the use-cases
    
- Place & draw the actors
    
- Draw the subject boundary
    
- Add the associations

## Business Process Identification with Use-Cases
- **Elements of Use-Case Diagrams**
    
- Actors: users        or other interacting systems
    
- Associations: lines to connect actors and use-cases
    
- Interactions, inclusions, or extensions
    
- Use-case:             a major process in the system that gives a benefit to the users 
    
- Subject boundary: a named box that depicts the scope 
    
- An association relationship: links an actor with the use case(s) with which it interacts

## Guidelines
- **Use case names denote action (should have a verb)**
    
- Aside form the association relationship.
    
- Use the include relationship to simplify use cases or avoid repetitions.
    
- For providing simplicity to the use case diagrams, updating the ‘Extension’ section is the preferred solution, rather that using the extend relationships.

# Capture Business Process Through Use Case Text Description
- **Identify business processes and use cases.**
    
- Create use-case diagrams
    
- Introduce activity diagrams.
    
- Create use case descriptions.
    
- Introduce the rules and style guidelines for use case descriptions.
    
- Create functional models of business processes using use-case diagrams, activity diagrams, and use case descriptions.

## Functional Modeling
- **Use Cases (What? And Why)**
    
- A use case describes the system’s behavior under various conditions as the system responds to a request from one of the stakeholders, called the primary actor (Cockburn 2001)
    
- Request from primary actor
    
- Change in the internal state of the system
    
- Response from the system


- **Why study use cases?**
    
- Describes what the system will do, revealing its scope, i.e., its purpose in life.
    
- A basis for negotiation.
    
- A basis for cost and schedule estimation
    
- Uncover surprises and missing requirements
    
- Brainstorming of what can go wrong
    
- A basis for other analysis and design artifacts.

## Use Case Text Description
- **Identify the use-cases**
    
- Expand a use-case
    
- Confirm the major use-casesv


## Identifying the Use Cases
- **Identify the system’s scope and boundaries (in/out list)**
    
- List the primary actors
    
- List the goals of each primary actor (Actor-Goal list)
    
- Write an overview (brief description) for each of the use cases
    
- Reconsider and revise the use cases

## Elements of a Use Case Description Document
- **Stakeholders and actors**
    
- Preconditions, triggers and guarantees
    
- Main success scenario (Basic flow)
    
- Extensions (Alternate flows)

## Use Case Writing Guidelines
- **Write in the form of subject-verb-direct object**
    
- Make sure it is clear who the initiator of the step is
    
- Write from independent observer’s perspective
    
- Write in a convenient level of abstraction
    
- Ensure the use case has a sensible set of steps
    
- Apply the KISS principle liberally.
    
- Write repeating instructions after the set of steps to be repeated

## Use Case Writing Guidelines
- **Pick a high priority use-case and create an overview:**
    
- List the primary actor
    
- List all stakeholders and their interests
    
- Determine the level of importance of the use-case
    
- Briefly describe the use-case
    
- List what triggers the use-case
    
- List its relationship to other use-cases
    

- Fill in the steps of the normal flow of events required to complete the use-case


- **Ensure that the steps listed are not too complicated or long and are consistent in size with other steps**
    
- Identify and write the alternate or exceptional flows
    
- Carefully review the use-case description and confirm that it is correct
    
- Iterate over the entire set of steps again


- **Have 3-10 steps per use case**
    
- Avoid very small steps like, user hits tab key
    
- Action steps – Include a reasonable set of actions
    
- A step (or a series of steps) represents a transaction:
    
- The primary actor sends request and data to the system
    
- The system validates the request and the data
    
- The system alters its internal state
    
- The system responds to the actor with the result

## Use Cases
- **The primary driver for all UML diagramming techniques**
    
- Depicts activities performed by the users
    
- Describe basic functions of the system:
    
- What the user can do
    
- How the system responds
    
- Use cases are building blocks for continued design activities
    

- Each use-case describes 1 and only 1 function

- **Library Manager or Library Employee enters borrower information and system displays books checked out information.**
    

  

- Does not matter who exactly is doing the process, more importantly is the role “Librarian”. 
    
- The use case should be divided into 2 sub use cases.
    

  

- Library Manager or Library Employee confirm return and enter “OK”
    

  

- Wrong actor, system is the right answer.

- **Library manager check books for damages.**
    

  

- Checking damages has nothing to do with the system behavior and should not be captured in the use cases.
    

  

- The system updates the “Maintain Borrower Information” and “Maintain Book Information” databases.
    

  
The system updates borrowing information

- Action steps –Write from a bird’s eye view

- **Pseudo like (bad)**
    

  

- Get ATM card and PIN numbers
    

  

- Deduct amount from account balance

- **Use case standards (good)**
    

  

- The customer puts in the ATM card and PIN
    

  

- The system deducts the amount from the account balance

- **Pseudo like (bad)**
    

  

- The system check whether the password is correct
    

  

- If it is, the system presents the available actions for the user

- **Use case standards (good)**
    
  

- The system validates that the password is correct
    

  

- The system presents the available actions to the user
