#### New

**Three Domains:**

- **Foundation**
- **People**
- **Creation**

This approach can be applied to any project, program, or strategic initiative. It emphasizes delivering value and benefits over adhering to rigid processes and controls. The focus is on rapidly identifying and delivering the elements that provide the greatest value.

---
**Purpose and Strategic Alignment**  
This approach ensures that every project is purpose-driven and aligned with your organization’s strategy.

**Key Features:**

- **Focus on Implementation:** Prioritizes execution over extensive planning.
- **Lifecycle Coverage:** Extends beyond the traditional project lifecycle to include pre-project aspirations and post-project benefits.
- **Flexibility:** Adapts quickly to changes as needed.

Project Canvas is a versatile tool, used at every stage of the project—before it begins, during its execution, near completion, and even after it’s concluded.

---
**Key Roles and Process**

- **Essential Roles:** A project requires both a **Project Manager** and a **Project Sponsor** to ensure success.
- **Inclusive Support:** The Project Canvas is designed to support all stakeholders involved in the project.

**Project Manager Responsibilities:**

1. Facilitate a meeting to build consensus among stakeholders.
2. Review the project's goals, scope, and key details.
3. Guide participants through the elements of the Canvas template.
4. Summarize key themes and insights for each domain and building block of the project.

---
**Refinement and Collaboration**

- **Thoughtful Iteration:** Now is the time for careful consideration and focused refinement.
- **Readiness Check:** If two or more building blocks are missing or unclear, it may be too early and too risky to begin the project.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Share your draft document with stakeholders to gather their feedback and make necessary adjustments.

**Dynamic Document:**  
The Project Canvas is a living document that should be revisited and updated regularly throughout the project's lifecycle.

#### Old
- It can be applied to any project, program, or strategic initiative. 
    
- It focuses on value and benefits rather than processes and controls, and it encourages you to focus on how to quickly deliver the elements of greatest value.

---
- It helps you ensure that every project has a purpose and lines up with your organization’s strategy. 
    
- It focuses on implementation rather than detailed planning, and—this is critical—it spans not just the traditional project life cycle but also the pre- and post project phases, to include aspirations and benefits. It’s flexible and allows changes to be made*quickly whenever necessary
    
- Project Canvas is used before, during, near the end, and after the project is completed.

---
- Needs project manager, and project sponsor
    
- Project canvas supports this dynamic 
    
- Canvas must support everybody
    
- Project manager must run a meeting to obtain consensus. 
    

- Review the goals, scope, and details of the project, and walk through the elements of the canvas template
    
- summarize the main themes that have emerged for each domain and building block
---
- Now is the time for some careful thought and focused iteration 
    
- If you are missing or unclear about two or more building blocks, it’s probably too early and too risky to start your project. 
    
- Next step is to share the document you’ve produced with other stakeholders and incorporate their feedback.
    
- The canvas is now a living document, to be revisited regularly.


## The Project Canvas
This framework ensures that every project has a purpose and lines up with your organization’s strategy. It is a living document, to be revisited
anytime you face a major decision or make changes to the scope of the project

# The Project Canvas

I’ve created just such a framework for
the executives and managers I teach
and advise across the globe—a one-
page strategic template that I call the
project canvas. The concept is inspired
by the business model canvas devel-
oped by Alex Osterwalder and Yves
Pigneur and used by millions of people
worldwide. Both Alex and Yves helped
with early brainstorming for the design
of the project canvas. A few other
frameworks with the same name exist,
but none has been as widely adopted as
this one.
**The framework is composed of just**
**three domains: foundation, people, and**
**creation. Each domain is vital to the**
**success of any project. (See the exhibit**
**“The Project Canvas.”)**
What distinguishes the project canvas
from other guides to project manage-
ment? A lot of things. **It can be applied**
**to any project, program, or strategic ini-**
**tiative. It focuses on value and benefits**
**rather than processes and controls, and**
**it encourages you to focus on how to**
**quickly deliver the elements of greatest**
**value. It helps you ensure that every**
**project has a purpose and lines up with**
**your organization’s strategy. It focuses**
**on implementation rather than detailed**
**planning, and—this is critical—it spans**
**not just the traditional project life cycle**
**but also the pre- and postproject phases,**
**to include aspirations and benefits. It’s**
**flexible and allows changes to be made**
**quickly whenever necessary.**
The project canvas works with all
project-management methodologies,
and it guides each stage of the process.

It is used before the project begins, to
assess how well it has been defined
and whether it’s ready to go. It is used
throughout the project to track progress
and ensure that critical elements and
assumptions remain valid. It is used
near the end, to assess whether the proj-
ect is delivering its intended benefits,
and after the project is over, to capture
lessons learned and build up competen-
cies found to be lacking.

**The canvas process begins** just before
you invest heavily in a project but **after**
**you have put both a project manager**
**and a project sponsor in place.** **Those**
**two roles are key to the success of any**
**project.** It’s common to think of a project
manager as focusing primarily on the
technical aspects of the project—with
the goal of providing the deliverables
on time, within scope, and on budget—
while the project sponsor oversees
and supports the project manager and
ensures that the project stays true to
its purpose and delivers its promised
benefits. **But that division diminishes**
**the role of the project manager, who also**
**needs to be concerned with purpose**
**and benefits**. When it comes to how a
project is run and what its goals are,
the manager and the sponsor must be
on the same page—which, of course, is
exactly what the project canvas makes
possible.
**The canvas has to work for every-**
**body, so it must be built on consensus.**
**The project manager should start by**
**convening a project-definition work-**
**shop**—a meeting that brings together
the **project sponsor, key stakeholders,**
**and company experts, not to mention**
**anybody else who might provide rele-**
**vant information, including customers**
**and suppliers**. This meeting might take
two or three hours. Don’t rush it. Make
sure everybody has a blank copy of the
canvas. **Review the goals, scope, and**
**details of the project, and walk through**
**the elements of the canvas template.**
**Then have everybody brainstorm for a**
**while**. Start with the foundation, and
then move through the other domains
and their building blocks. Ask partici-
pants to share their views and opinions,
and then using a master copy of the
canvas, summarize the main themes
that have emerged for each domain and
building block. **You’ll now start to see a**
**picture of the challenges ahead.**
At this point, your canvas will have
a lot of information on it. Ask yourself,
**Does it all work together as a cohesive**
**and integrated whole? Does it make**
**sense from a strategic and an organiza-**
**tional perspective? Does it acknowledge**
**that you’ll be implementing your project**
**in a fast-changing and multiple-priority**
**environment?** Now is the time for some
careful thought and focused iteration. **If**
**you are missing or unclear about two or**
**more building blocks, it’s probably too**
**early and too risky to start your project.**
**Take more time to define them. And if**
**you still can’t do that, don’t start the**
**project at all.**
When the meeting ends, the process
is far from over. **Your next step is to**
**share the document you’ve produced**
**with other stakeholders and incorporate**
**their feedback.**
**The canvas is now a living document,**
**to be revisited regularly**. Consult it each
time you face a major decision, and
update it any time you make changes to
the nature of the project or your goals.
You might even want to feature the can-
vas in your drumbeat communications.
Consider producing a video, drafting an
article, or facilitating a short workshop
around one (or more) of the elements in
the canvas on a regular cycle—**perhaps**
**once a month**
