# How to handle the Social Security Breach

Professor Taylor suggests we should make six accounts

## First 3 are gov accounts
First account: Social Security Administration
- We can make an account on https://www.ssa.gov/
- Log in, and we can see our claims, identify theft against us, or people trying to apply to stuff with our names
- We get to view a statement

2nd account: IRS.gov
- We can request for a pin whenever we file for taxes
- www.irs.gov

3rd account: Mail
- https://www.usps.com/
- Informed delivery
- You get a photo of incoming mail 

4th account: DMV
- Create a DMV account
- That way nobody can register for a car under your name
- https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/

5th account: Unemployment
- If someone files for unemployment under our behalf
- If you ever need it, your funds are gone
- https://edd.ca.gov/unemployment/

## Last 3 are credit Beuros
https://www.equifax.com/
https://www.transunion.com/
https://www.experian.com/

If we make an account with all of these, we can lock our credit.
If someone tries to open an account in our name, nothing will happen, I'll receive an alert. 

## More to consider
If you don't make a linkedin account, the higher your responsibility, the higher the odds that someone else will make an account for you. 

We are legally allowed to have 1 free credit report a year. **Important for us who wants to work in government**. 
- https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action
- We can confirm what is true and what is false.

Consider having your own domain name. "mariocanales.com". If you get your own domain, you get your own email address? If you assign a domain to your email.....If you apply for a tech job, and you have a gmail, outlook, or yahoo, that it makes it a little less technical.

End result should look something like this:

- Not including the OSINT or the AI workshop machines

If we want to make a writeup on how to create a secure testing environment as of 2024, we will get extra credit.
