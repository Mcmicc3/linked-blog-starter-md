1:18

unit I want to ask you all to you what is cancel

1:24

culture what does cancel culture mean to you so if you want to hit pause on this recording and think about your answer

1:29

answer to that please feel free

1:35

to let me show you a video from a recent episode of so-called cancel culture

1:42

where some people accused others of trying to cancel comedian Dave Chappelle

1:48

over his jokes about transgender people let's watch this NBC news report on what

1:54

happened tonight comedian Dave Chappelle once again at the center of a swirling

1:59

controversy oh buddy I'm in trouble now the polarizing standup drawing Swift

2:05

backlash for jokes at his latest special the closer gender is a fact this is a fact every human being in this room

2:11

every human being on Earth had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth critics characterizing the remarks

2:19

as transphobic and slamming Netflix for airing them Turf is an acronym stands

2:25

for Trans exclusionary radical feminists this is a real thing this is a group of women

2:31

that hate transgender they don't hate transgender women but they look at trans women the way we blacks might look at

2:36

blackface I'm team Turf I agree I agree man gender is a fact the

2:46

special prompting some to boycott the service or cut ties today a group of transgender employees at Netflix

2:52

announcing plans to Stage a walk out next week Netflix recently suspending three employees who criticize the street

2:59

dreaming giant but now lifting that suspension one of the employees trans software developer terara field had

3:06

openly questioned Netflix's decision to air the special tweeting promoting Turf ideology which is what we did by giving

3:13

it a platform yesterday directly harms trans people Netflix insisting it suspended field and two others for

3:20

attending an online executive meeting they were not invited to not for speaking out but despite growing calls

3:27

to remove the special from its platforms Netflix standing by Chappelle in an

3:32

internal memo first obtained by The Verge the company's co-ceo writing we don't allow titles on Netflix that are

3:37

designed to incite hate or violence and we don't believe the closer crosses that line but major lgbtq advocacy

3:45

organizations like glad disagree it seems that it's cisgender people trying

3:51

to tell trans people again what is harmful to us and what isn't why is this

3:57

such a serious concern Beyond just entertainment for the lgbtq plus

4:03

Community well none of the experiences that we have with media exists in a

4:08

vacuum so you can say that it's just jokes but unfortunately the millions of

4:13

people who will watch a comedy special like this for many of them this is their

4:19

introduction or their only interaction with a trans narrative all right do sh

4:25

bur joins us now live on set so you said it in your report there Netflix is standing by Dave Chapelle what's Dave Chappelle saying well he's not

4:32

responding directly to requests for comment about this but as you know he's certainly No Stranger uh to controversy

4:38

Tom and just recently he performed at a star studded and sold out event at the

4:44

Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and at times he took aim at Twitter and at cancel culture at one point he received

4:50

a standing ovation and in response to that uh he said if this is what getting canceled looks like then I love it so if

4:57

that's any indication it does not seem like he is back in down and and Netflix is not either at this point Tom okay

5:02

Dasha we thank you for that all right let me stop it there and so uh Chappelle

5:09

by the way um at least according to Scholars who work in matters of identity and gender um Chappelle seems to be

5:16

confusing the concept of gender with uh with sex um but anyway uh so um that

5:26

those jokes from Chappelle produced um a lot of back back lash and there are those who called the backlash attempts

5:33

to cancel Chappelle so here you can see um another tweet from the person in the

5:40

news wrapup Tera field I give you a few seconds to read

5:49

that and then you can see some more of the backlash from another uh Tweeter or

5:55

exer uh on the bottom right

6:05

so Chappelle then told his audience that he has been cancelled and a transgender activist

6:11

says he continues mocking us as you heard in the news report um he received a standing ovation at some of his shows

6:18

right after this and so he said well if this is what cancelling looks like you know kind of Bring It On if you will and

6:24

so uh today we're going to talk through or continue our study of digital culture

6:30

but this time look at a particular and controversial facet of digital culture and that is and a facet and aspect that

6:38

we've all heard about in different ways over the last few years and that is cancel culture So today we're going to

6:44

flesh out what cancel culture is and look at two differing perspectives on it

6:50

two diametrically opposed perspectives on it and then end with what role

6:56

digital media play in so-call cancel culture so our two perspectives

7:03

the first one is going to say that it is Mob mentality and it's just public shaming that's out of control but a very

7:10

different perspective will say actually actually canel culture can be understood as a form of empowerment from those

7:16

groups who lack power in society all right let's get to the core

7:24

of what cancel culture really is here's how we can define it Collective

7:30

strategies by activists using social pressures to achieve cultural

7:37

ostracism of targets targets being someone or

7:42

something excuse me accused of offensive words or

7:48

deeds that key word cultural ticism what does that mean that means ostracism means

7:56

shunning canel culture at its core is an attempt to hold powerful people

8:03

the influential the wealthy thought leaders prominent people people who have

8:09

some kind of prominent position in society therefore they have power cancel

8:14

culture is at its core an attempt to hold powerful people accountable by what

8:20

damaging their reputations by derailing their

8:27

careers by deny in them access to public platforms you've probably heard this

8:33

term deplatforming sometimes what some people say is cancellation or cancel

8:40

culture has led to uh certain platforms kicking people off of those

8:45

platforms um not as often now that musk owns what used to be called Twitter X but uh still sometimes there in addition

8:54

to our other social media so deplatforming or denying access to public platforms and sometimes maybe not

9:01

all that often but sometimes cancel culture so-called cancel culture can establish grounds for legal prosecutions

9:11

if um an attempt a ground swell of criticism uh brings to light uh the

9:17

possibility of a of a legal Pro prosecution and for example is in the statute of limitations for when a crime

9:24

can be prosecuted here's some more basic tenants of this concept of canel

9:32

culture activists use Collective expressions of

9:37

outrage over speech or actions judged morally inappropriate and defensive so

9:45

notice that when these these out this outrage is over things that are deemed not

9:51

illegal although that can that can occur too but usually the outrage centers on

9:57

things that are offensive inappropriate ethically inappropriate

10:02

morally wrong kle culture targets powerful

10:10

public figures who were widely regarded as transgressing acceptable moral standards

10:17

of conduct many of these powerful figures appear above the reach of the law and

10:25

that is when sometimes communities or ground swell of Community Action can

10:31

come together to try to shun ostracize hold these powerful Pig figures who

10:37

often seem Above the Law because for example they can just hire the best attorneys can hold them to account by

10:43

shaming them through things like social media so what you see on the top left of

10:49

the screen are all people who some say

10:54

there have been attempts to cancel Jimmy Fallon jod comr lad

11:00

JK Rowling who some say there's been attempts to cancel her because of this

11:06

Turf ideology trans exclusionary radical feminist ideology and Ellen degenerous

11:12

because of the supposed um hostile conditions at the Ellen TV show and The

11:18

podcaster Joe Rogan apparently has been uh there have been attempts to cancel him because of the out uh outrageous or

11:26

controversial guests and topics that's discussed on his podcast on Spotify so that the broader goals of

11:34

cancel culture are to share Collective expressions of moral outrage mobilize

11:41

public opinion and demand actions from decision makers for example decision makers like uh CEOs of

11:49

companies um production companies uh distribution companies media properties

11:56

that can do something about it if one of the people associated with their

12:01

organization is seen to have transgressed some moral uh

12:07

boundaries so what you see in front of you is an example um from The

12:12

Bachelor where one of the women on The Bachelor um was accused of trying to um

12:21

intimidate or bully people who dated uh interracially when she was in high school but then seemed very interested

12:29

in dating interracially when she was on the show The Bachelor and so some people said that

12:36

some communities were trying to cancel her this contestant on The

12:42

Bachelor this is another example of so-called cancel cancel culture um the

12:48

ground swell of criticism for Kanye West after he made anti-semitic comments and

12:54

some people observed the cause and effect largely to be well first the

13:00

cause were his comments but what really led to Theus dropping Kanye was the

13:06

ground SW of criticism from social media According to some

13:12

people here's a really important point of caution now we've seen already in our

13:18

topics in this course in several in fact many occasions it's important to make or

13:24

to note points of caution for example that that participatory culture began

13:32

with social media or the internet it did not social media just facilitates more opportunities for participatory culture

13:38

than ever before so we've seen when we talk about digital media digital

13:43

culture uh it's important that we make certain notes points of caution red

13:48

flags caveats and here's one with regard to cancel culture a point of caution is

13:53

that this notion of ostracizing someone or something or some group in other

14:00

words shaming them the whole notion of public shaming

14:06

is not new at all in fact one of the most popular um novels in American

14:13

literature the history of American literature is called The Scarlet Letter and describes exactly that an episode of

14:22

public shaming and in this case the woman um in a small village in the

14:28

Northeast has prin uh was accused of adultery and then was forced to wear The

14:33

Scarlet Letter A uh on her body or on her clothes as she went about a business thus marking

14:40

her and publicly shaming her so this notion of ostracization public shaming shunning

14:48

people publicly is not new in fact is as old as

14:53

time now let me share with you and discuss with you two two opposing

15:00

diametrically opposed perspectives on cancel

15:05

culture the first perspective is very critical of cancel culture and says that cancel culture is kind of like mob

15:13

mentality it's a mob mentality and public shaming shaming of public figures

15:20

on a large scale has gotten out of control has run a muck that's our first

15:25

perspective and it is a perspective that some of you maybe even many of you may agree with or may

15:32

not those who hold this perspective note that cancel culture silences free speech

15:39

and open debate and in our country and others Free Speech Western democracies

15:46

is held as a really important value and other places but notably in Western democracies and so for example Pierce

15:54

Morgan who's a journalist that some of you may have heard of he used to host a CNN show then he went back over to

15:59

England to host one of their uh morning breakfast TV shows he criticized heavily Megan Markle

16:06

after Megan Markle and Prince Harry uh came on TV and in public and criticized

16:11

the royal family of England uh and then uh it is said by some that Pierce Morgan was cancelled so

16:20

much criticism that he then quit his pretty awesome lucrative uh comfortable

16:29

row uh excuse me not row uh role on this British morning TV

16:36

show and so for some people such cancellation practice as

16:42

silence is Free Speech right he should in a in a free country and a western democracy uh he should have the ability

16:48

to criticize other people without being cancelled so some people say cancel culture silence is free speech and open

16:56

debate another observation that people who hold

17:01

this first perspective make is that cancel culture is actually a slippery

17:06

slope what starts here or maybe a limited attempt snowballs into something

17:13

bigger and larger and on a greater scale some people say that slippery

17:19

slope that cancel culture is a slippery slope silencing not just one or a couple

17:25

but an array of unpopular perspectives

17:31

for example some people say that it is gone too

17:36

far uh when people have according to some tried to cancel JK Rowling for her views on

17:45

trans people not only that but others note

17:51

that the slippery slope then went into all domains of culture including Dr

17:57

Seuss the kids books uh who apparently whose books apparently contain some um references uh to gender

18:07

and race that are stereotypes and could be viewed as offensive and so therefore

18:12

even these long-standing best-selling children's books um According to some

18:17

observers were cancelled so some people observe a slippery slope was starts on

18:23

one thing kind of snowballs into attempts to cancel all kinds of uh cultural artifacts acts in society

18:30

here's another example of what some might say is a slippery slope uh when the

18:36

publisher of these other uh really famous children's books by roel doll

18:41

some of them one is James and the Giant Peach uh The BFG is another really um

18:47

popular children's book that was made into a movie by roal doll

18:53

and as a result of what some say is cancel culture the publisher at one

18:58

point had decided that it was going to publish the original which may contain some offensive stereotypes these these

19:04

books were published many decades ago with different views at that time the

19:10

publisher was going to publish the original alongside an updated version of

19:16

these children's books that contained substituted language that is less

19:22

offensive but due to backlash about this uh the publisher eventually decided they

19:28

would not be updated so some people see for example

19:34

the attempt to uh change or remove longstanding children's books movies TV

19:42

as a slippery slope of cancel culture run a

19:47

up people who hold this first perspective that cancel culture is essentially out of control note that

19:53

cancel culture May ultimately undermine something that is

19:58

important in society and that is tolerance of contrarians contrarians are people who hold views that are different

20:05

to what most people have so for example if uh you live in a time of um military

20:12

conflict and people are feeling very patriotic for example if America was involved when somebody would criticize

20:20

that war effort that person would be a contrarian so contrarians are people who hold a different view than the one that

20:26

the majority adopts it is important in free societies to have contrarians and

20:31

contrarian views and so some people say that Council culture undermines our

20:36

society's tolerance of contrarians in addition people who think

20:42

that cancel control excuse me cancel culture is out of control uh May argue

20:49

that cancel culture generates what is called group think that is people adopt the opinions of what they see as the

20:56

masses so you may see this online in your uh

21:01

social media communities um it seems that some communities online uh Tik Tok

21:08

is one they're According to some not myself but according to some maybe group

21:13

think with regard to whether to support one side or the other in the conflict

21:19

that's going on right now in the Middle East Israel or Gaza or the gazen people

21:24

so some people see the way that some communities tend to have same opinions

21:30

same views some networks some social networks within a social platform some people observe group think in those

21:41

spaces in addition people who believe that cancel culture is group think and

21:47

uh attempts to uh silence people run a muck out of control they note that

21:53

freedom of speech is needed especially for the expression of UN popular and

21:59

contrarian opinions as similar to the point we just made people who hold this view for

22:05

example May note that cancel culture is common on college campuses on University

22:12

uh campuses where cancel culture this kind

22:18

of ground swell of criticism May prohibit certain voices on campus for

22:23

example conservative voices in the US Republican voices

22:29

or you may observe more recently that according to some uh support for Israel

22:35

According to some uh was attempted to be cancelled by uh critics and protesters

22:42

of the War uh who were very critical of Israel's military action so that's one

22:49

perspective that Council culture is group think it's a slippery slope leading to a whole variety of of of of

22:57

thoughts and expression and opinions and content being cancelled that it silences

23:03

a very important thing we need in society and that is unpopular views contrarians some people think that

23:09

cancel culture is out of control other people however take a very

23:16

different perspective on cancel

23:21

culture these people will argue wait a second Council culture is not just group

23:27

think run a muck canel culture is actually a form of

23:35

empowerment empowerment means bringing power to certain groups certain people

23:41

especially those groups who previously had lacked power people who hold this very

23:49

different view than the first one we discussed they would argue that public

23:54

shaming whether that is in the old days offline or in in our time online and

23:59

social media public shaming actually has a legitimate important role in

24:06

society for example criticizing racial or homophobic

24:11

slurs highlighting unacceptable abuses of power so that they're brought out

24:17

into the open and not just tucked away and pushed out of sight so we don't hear about

24:23

them another type of legitimate role may be criticizing those who engage in

24:29

cultural appropriation cultural appropriation is when a member of a

24:36

dominant group takes elements from another groups usually a group that

24:42

doesn't have the same power takes elements from their culture for example their music or fashion in a in an

24:49

inauthentic way in a way that's just kind of Dipping into to borrow elements then then dipping out without really

24:56

concerned about well-being of that culture that is taken that Community who

25:02

is taken from people who view cancel culture as a

25:09

form of empowerment make a very important observation for this

25:15

perspective they observe that analysis of cancel culture shouldn't just start with when

25:23

someone is so-called silenced or forced to apologize or forced out of public public life or even forced to change

25:31

careers analysis of cancel culture according to this second perspective

25:36

must start with the power relations by which it is defined what do we mean here

25:43

well people who hold this perspective the second perspective would note for example

25:49

that often times types of people different groups don't have the same

25:55

opportunities to make their voices heard for example it has often been that when

26:02

people would submit a letter or an article to an opinion editorial page of

26:09

a newspaper that marginalized groups for example

26:15

communities of color their representatives would get published less than dominant groups or for example at a

26:21

town hall meeting a meeting in a community that the people who a fil

26:28

Freer to stand up and ask questions and make their voice heard and be the ones the people who are allowed to speak who

26:35

are called on for example are usually members of dominant groups most often uh

26:42

males and most often whites or we may observe for example

26:49

that only recently and we still don't have a state of equality people of color

26:55

will not cast in roles that they may be just as qualified for as people who are

27:01

not of color they're not cast as often in roles for TV and movie uh

27:10

content so people who hold the second perspective believe that cancel culture

27:17

the analysis of it and why it happens and why it might be important must start by acknowledging

27:25

that power is not spread equitably through Society some people some groups

27:31

do not have the same opportunities to make their voice heard or to gain prominence to be seen the way other

27:38

groups do people who hold the second opinion would argue that cancel culture is

27:46

actually an effective tool for Network groups networked meaning by using network platforms social

27:52

media to achieve social justice and cultural change espe especially for

27:59

marginalized groups people pushed to the margins for example under resource

28:05

groups who are powerless to obtain legal changes or

28:12

public apology so certain people often groups of color uh

28:20

women um lgbtq plus people often do not have the same

28:28

opportunities to Mount Legal challenges to win uh through our system of Juris

28:34

Prudence or don't have the same power to achieve a public apology from the person

28:40

being criticized or group being criticized so that cancle culture becomes really important for people who

28:47

have less opportunity to hold others to account through our legal system or

28:52

to obtain legal redress or or or public apology and so some

28:59

way and we can interpret Tera Field's post who we saw covered in the video and

29:06

we saw a screenshot from a few slides ago we can interpret Tera Field's

29:12

approach through this lens such criticism in this case of

29:20

Chappelle can be actually re really important for people of marginalized

29:26

communities or groups another important aspect of cancel culture for those who view it as a form

29:32

of empowerment is to understand how cancel culture socalled cancel culture

29:38

originated it originated in queer communities of color in other words

29:45

among people among groups who often were marginalized who often were stigmatized

29:50

who often did not have power and opportunities the way that other groups dominant groups

29:56

would so so-called cancel culture originated in queer communities of color

30:01

and was made popular through what has often been called black Twitter we can

30:08

Define black Twitter as a network of culturally connected

30:14

communicators using the platform formerly Twitter now X to draw attention

30:20

to issues of concern to Black communities so so here is important to

30:26

understand the origins of the concept to understand how how this

30:34

strategy was adopted by people who have often been marginalized and who have

30:39

lacked the same opportunities to make their voices heard in

30:45

society those who hold the second perspective also note that excuse me

30:50

public figures because they are public figures they have certain responsibilities to behave speak and

30:58

certain ethical moral ways failing short of that people in the

31:04

second perspective note that public figures should be held to account

31:10

precisely because they are public figures cancelling from this second

31:15

perspective is seen as a choice not something that is mandated by

31:21

the government or by a judge but a choice to withdraw attention from

31:27

someone or something regarded as morally or ethically

31:34

offensive and so this screenshot alludes again to what some have said is attempts

31:39

to cancel Ellen degenerous because of um uh what has been accused to be

31:48

harassment and sexual misconduct at her

31:54

show this is another example uh in this case it's not a public figure

32:00

like El degenerous but it is a brand a a food brand that has had a

32:07

prominent role in American culture consumer culture over the last many

32:16

decades because it used to produce uh products with bottles that reinforce

32:22

stereotypes relating to race and the unfortunate history of slavery in

32:29

America and so for people who hold this second

32:34

perspective public figures or brands that for example reinforce stereotypes that come from the era of slavery should

32:41

be held to account and so we we we should view that as

32:48

important those are two perspectives on cancel culture to opposed diametrically

32:55

p uh opposed perspective I on cancel culture let's end this unit with delving

33:02

more into the role of digital media our core concern in this class the role of digital media in cancel

33:10

culture well first of all we can note that cancel culture grew among

33:15

decentralized networks means a network that doesn't have a center Hub there's no command center decentralized networks

33:22

like those that so many of us are involved with online on social media decent Iz networks of likeminded digital

33:32

activists mobilizing around Progressive social causes and uniting around hashtags for example on that we've all

33:39

heard of me too and black lives matter so the ability of digital media to

33:45

facilitate not centralized command centered type systems but rather

33:51

networks that are decentralized and that for example unite around things like memes and hashtags is

33:58

fundamental to uh so-called cancel culture to give you an

34:05

example of decentralized networks that mobilize we have this classic example of

34:13

the me to movement so Alissa Milano was actually not the person who came up with

34:19

the me to hashtag and and framing but is credited uh with um bringing a lot of

34:26

attention to it uh when she posted the tweet that you see on the left there in

34:32

2017 so that on Sunday October 15th 2017 at 12m there were 295 mentions of

34:39

me too on Twitter and at 10 p.m. there were over 83,000

34:47

mentions another important point with regard to the role or influence of

34:53

digital media in cancel culture is that there's a kind of what we call in

34:59

communication in media studies an intermedia agenda setting effect viral

35:05

online posts that contain accusations like we've discussed in this unit can

35:12

spark cover coverage in the mass media meaning the non- interet media mass

35:20

media uh types of platforms and media for example TV cable TV radio op-eds and

35:31

newspapers for example those me too tweets uh the origin not the origin but

35:37

the a flasho that we just looked at with the Alysa Milano 2017

35:43

tweet and the community who mobilized around that hashtag many many many

35:49

thousands then led to as we all know significant mass media newspaper

35:57

Mass Magazine TV coverage of the me to movement so there was what we call an

36:02

intermedia agenda setting effect digital media in this case social media set the

36:08

media agenda for magazines newspapers

36:13

TV and what do we know uh Harvey Weinstein was ultimately held to account

36:19

uh and in this case uh legal challenges were brought and Weinstein was convicted

36:25

of sexual assault in LA sentenc to 16 years in addition to being convicted in

36:30

New York state although recently you may have heard in the news that the judge a

36:36

judge in appeals court throughout the New York conviction so he is going to be retried

36:43

but the LA sentence Still Remains in place at least as of now uh so

36:51

the backlash and cultural community of the me too movement not only led to mass

36:59

media news coverage but also led to the prosecution of public figures including

37:07

Weinstein studies of council culture note that the intense culture wars we

37:14

have a situation now we have frequent flas points in the culture wars usually between right and left in this country

37:20

they arise in part excuse me because of activists connected through digital

37:26

social networks like X or Twitter and we have uh a recent flash point in the

37:32

culture war and that revolves around um the conversation around WNBA player

37:38

Caitlyn Clark uh with some people having all kinds of views on her based in part on

37:45

the intersection of her race and her gender and so you had a uh a a a um host

37:55

of an ESPN show named Pat McAfee a white man um using the phrase white b

38:03

t c uh unquote to describe Caitlyn Clark um and then a lot of

38:11

backlash uh in response to what he said about

38:17

her so culture War flash points can arise and can take shape because of

38:23

activists connected through digital media the politics of outrage when so many of

38:32

our our so much of our discourse as we all noted in the recent years is about

38:37

anger and outrage this politics of outrage is reinforced by water called filter

38:44

Bubbles and Echo Chambers among likeminded people

38:49

online filter bubbles is a scenario where we all have a filter bubble and

38:56

the only information really that gets in is information that is often consistent

39:02

with what we already believe why because what we're seeing on social media is based on an

39:08

algorithm that is taking into account who we already are connected with and

39:14

their likes and dislikes or you might note for example that we can select into

39:19

which kind of news coverage online we want to watch we want to we want to stream we want to

39:25

share so really we're all in these filter bubbles where the only kind of

39:31

viewpoints opinions and information that's coming into US is consistent with what we already believe likeminded

39:37

people because that is what the algorithm believes that we'll pay attention to why do we have those

39:42

algorithms we'll delve into this later in the course because that is what's going to get people to click more you

39:47

get people to click more the companies are able to to to make more money on

39:52

Advertising these filter bubbles where information that is consistent with what we already believe filters in by

39:59

algorithms to our information bubbles these bubbles create Echo chamers so

40:06

people are largely living in Echo Chambers where we're hearing opinions about society that are close to what we

40:14

already believe and the key Point here in terms of digital media is that these filter

40:21

Bubbles and Echo Chambers arise because of largely mainly because of digital

40:26

media and algorithms another aspect of the role of

40:32

digital media is that patterns of social media use are expected to amplify reach

40:38

and expand the voice of younger folks especially this is Pew data it shows how

40:46

old people are that use each type of social media platform you can see that the biggest age differential here is an

40:54

Instagram most of Instagram's user ship comes from people who were younger 18 to 29 as opposed to older a similar pattern

41:03

can be noted with regard to Snapchat and Tik Tock there's much less age

41:09

difference when you get down to the bottom with Facebook older folks are on Facebook

41:14

right so these newer platforms that are gaining more popularity that are

41:22

becoming more prominent are often dominated by young people

41:29

and that means that their voices their causes are going to be Amplified because

41:36

of the age differences that characterize each different kind of social media

41:44

platform another aspect of the role of digital media in kenel culture is that online tweets and posts are Amplified

41:53

through interpersonal communication communication between people and groups Elite rhetoric that means the

42:00

type of communication from public leaders and from people who have prominent roles in society from

42:07

journalists and from media commentators here's an example of a

42:13

LeBron post that is

42:23

Amplified right so uh there's a certain um uh Viewpoint in

42:31

society uh in this case that um certain uh athletes public figures celebrities

42:37

stars of color should just concentrate on what they do in this case play basketball right that's been the criticism of some people on the right

42:43

with regard to LeBron James and he said hold on no we're not gonna I'm not going to just be quiet when for example there

42:50

is police misconduct and police violence against people of color right so so these kinds of posts

42:58

will be Amplified through groups talking to other groups through journalists

43:04

covering this media commentators covering this so sometimes online posts

43:09

that we've all noticed can be Amplified through communication with other people through journalists through commentators

43:17

and so on here's an important point of caution at this point with regard to uh the role

43:24

of digital media the culture wars are actually intensified according to Scholars by right-wing

43:31

commentators who are actually not primarily or dominantly on social media

43:38

for example on TV or talk radio and newspapers right because it fits their

43:44

agenda one example from former Fox News hosts would be tuer

43:51

Carlson who accused the left of trying to Target or trying to cancel Rudolph

43:57

Rednosed Reindeer trying to cancel Christmas that type of coverage is going

44:03

to get viewers on Fox news or in England they have what they were called red top

44:09

newspapers gossip newspapers talking about criticizing uh

44:14

Prince

44:20

Harry that criticism of Prince Harry anyone who tries to criticize him is

44:25

cancelled so the key Point here is that the culture wars in which digital media post

44:33

social media posts are important but those culture wars can often be stoked

44:38

by mass media Outlets public figures journalists commentators because it fits

44:46

their agenda another point of caution with regard

44:53

to overstating the role of digital media in Council culture is to think about the

44:58

timeline when social media were invented and became popular because if you look at this

45:03

history of social media timeline you'll see that the most common platforms that

45:08

we use now every day from YouTube 2005 to uh Twitter now X in

45:17

2006 uh were only invented and made popular roughly 15 20 years

45:24

ago so digital media cannot have caused cancel culture because there were

45:30

attempts to shame publicly ostracize public figures long before social media

45:37

became the dominant forms of how so many of us communicate so another important point

45:43

of caution here is that the timeline doesn't bear out the argument that

45:48

social media causes Council culture Council culture existed long before the early 2000s

45:57

in case uh you're interested in reading more about this from the scholarly point

46:03

of view these are the two sources that I used largely to put together this

46:08

presentation an article from pipa Norris called cancel culture myth or reality

46:13

and an article from Meredith Clark called drag them a brief atmology of so-called cancel culture so I'm

46:19

including that uh so that um if you want to read those articles you're interested in this uh you can find them on the Fall

46:26

Library website make sure that you read our two assigned pieces on ccil culture fact you

46:34

need to to address the discussion response for uh this week but make sure you read those that's a hint that you

46:41

can expect to see a question or two on the midterm from these readings all right let's end this unit

46:47

with some takeaways and further thought well first of all many public figures excuse me aren't actually cancelled

46:54

which is an interesting thing so some people say oh the sky is falling because uh so and so or groups online are trying

47:01

to cancel this public figure for example Joe Rogan the podcaster well he wasn't

47:07

actually cancelled he still has the very popular lucrative podcast on Spotify Dave Chappelle said well he was

47:14

still selling out his standup shows after he made what some say are transphobic comments and so he said well

47:20

this is what canel culture looks like essentially not his exact words bring it on so many public figures aren actually

47:27

cancelled despite the Uproar over so-called cancel culture this is a point made by pipon

47:33

Norris digital media likely reflect and

47:39

reinforce cancellation practices rather than drive them right and this also ties

47:47

into um what in the extreme could be technological

47:52

determinism it would be technologically deterministic to say that social media causes drives cancellation public

48:02

shaming Scholars say digital media likely reflect and reinforce attempts to shun shame

48:11

powerful people rather than cause them or drive them whatever your perspective on cancel

48:18

culture whether you agree more with that first perspective that we address that some view canel culture is out of

48:24

control uh run a muck just gone way too far or rather you agree or you agree

48:31

that the second perspective which is that cancel culture is an important form of

48:36

empowerment you are of course free to align more with either of those perspectives or both or another one it's

48:44

up to you I only ask that you understand that there is a different view that also

48:50

warrants our consideration so I'm not arguing making an argument to you to adopt one of the

48:55

two perspectives I'm simply asking that you understand them and realize that there is an opposing

49:03

perspective we talked briefly about how um offline or at least sources that are

49:12

not only online that are mass media as well newspaper and TV primarily they can fuel the culture wars especially on the

49:18

right wing but actually both sides fuel the court culture wars in digital spaces

49:26

about public figures what is acceptable and what is not and who should be able to hold them to

49:33

account and I'll finish on this point cancelling so-called attempts to cancel

49:40

powerful public figures cancellation practices and

49:46

criticizing those who are perceived to be trying to cancel people that's about

49:54

power who should be able to hold hold people to account who should be culturally or at

50:02

least uh in the court of public opinion stopped from being able to hold people to account who should be able to

50:09

criticize public figures that like so many so much of what we've talked about in this course

50:15

is an issue of power and that is it for this unit thank you very much for watching and for

50:21
