	What causes change?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605225232.png]]

Basis of causality: What causes change in society?
- Whether it's for the good or bad

#### 1st view: Technological determinism
Machines themsevles determine change
- Media, technology, machines

#### 2nd view: HUman decisions
Decisions, processes, routines, attitudes, lead to how we design communication technology, which then lead to change. 

What is responsible for causing change in society??
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605190109.png]]

Tinder example.
Today peopel are marrying later if at all, waiting to have children, stayling single longer, have more partners.
- Dating, marriage has changed

If thats the change, what is responible for it? The appearance and proliferation of these apps? or is it human attitudes values and traditions that are responsible for these dating apps and changing marriage.

You could argue that the ability to quickly find a new partner thanks to apps have led to change of marriage and relationships.

You could also argue the other perspective that it was our human values changed over the decades, such as playboy, birth control pills, alternative lifestyles, only when people were more liberated of their sexuality, did entrepenaurs take the time to make these apps.
## Technological Determinism
The view that *Technologies* cause change in society with little human reistance

- Usually when technologies are new
- Puts the power with technologies, not the people
- ![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605194523.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605194535.png]]

- Sounds disempowering to humans

Often a Binary when told:
**Dystopian vs Utupion**

## Dystopian Narratives
Apocalypse, things getting worse. Catastrophe.
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605194745.png]]

### Common Dystopian Narratives
- We are *Losing control* (i.e. tech is making us dumb; losing control of women)

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605195011.png]]
- Brought up that society feared if women had phones, they could now speak to who knows what. 
- Fear of losing control of young woman

We are becoming *dependent of tech* 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605195123.png]]

We are *Unable to stop change*

# What is a Dystopian View of Social Media in Society?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605195410.png]]
- Isolation
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605195425.png]]
What do these technologies have in common?
- At one point, each technology was greeted with a wave of Utopian interest, in how it was going to make society much better.

# 2. Social Construction of Technology
The view that *people* are the sources for both technology and society
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605195844.png]]

1. Tech. *Developer* and *designers* are subject to social contexts

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605200001.png]]
- Appealing to sexuality

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605201132.png]]
- Play on the name of john coltrane. Also a play on the tv show soul train. 
- Chun-li is offensive...asian woman 
*Identity Tourism.....* putting on a race or gender that isn't yours, only applys to white people. 


#### 2. Governments, organizations and users shape tech. development

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605201429.png]]
- Arguments that emojis used to push a different sterotype of woman around 8 years ago


# Which view do you agree with more?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605201725.png]]
- Use an example not discussed in class

## 3. Social Shaping
The view that technologies and people *both* influence each other

- An "in-between", "two-way" view
- People, technologies, and organizations **ALL** have power to influence the use of tech in society. 
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605202011.png]]

# Communication (e.g. movies) about technology is **reflective**

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605202243.png]]
- Matrix: Came out when the internet became popular. World in which we are enslaved by machines. 
	- **This reflects our hopes and fears of technology**. 
- her: Movie that reflects societys conversations on whether we can gain intimacy with technologies. 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605202337.png]]
- Who is the good or bad guys in a war between humans and AI. 


### Communication (e.g. movies) about technology is **reflective**
#### What concerns is ex machina debating?
1. is it possible to have lustful feelings with an AI?
2. Is it possible that they can get so intelligent that they'll deceive us
3. What will happen to AI when we're done with them?
4. What about a scenario where AIs infiltrate society and we can't tell the difference?

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605203104.png]]

The end scene shows that humans and AI have switched places. Scary red color, contrast with the color of living. 

The movie is reflecting the change of AI infiltrating into society.
What causes that change?

#### Is this scene consistent with Tech Determ. or SCOT?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605203345.png]]
- Scene where he explains how ava was created. 
- He explains that search engines are more than just using it as a method for competitors to figure out how to sell products to consumers. It shows how a search engine can show human thought.  How we seek data and what we do with it.
- This scene is more consistent with *scot*, because it is the creators choices to take everyones devices, connect them through blue book, and capture how people think to develop an AI.

#### Is this scene consistent with Tech Determ. or SCOT?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605203827.png]]
- This scene is an example of Tech Determ, because it shows how humans have lost control over tech, that they created them to be so intelligent that it deceived that one guy, and murdered the other guy. 

Overall, which is this movie more consistent with? Probably `#3`
- **Social shaping.** Machines, technologies, and human decisions, sterotypes and processes all shape society and make change.

# Digital media and Society?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605204309.png]]
- We can see headlines like this and understand that it's consistent with a distyopian narrative
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240605204348.png]]
- We can see headlines like this and understand that it's consistent with a utopian narrative

# Takeaways and Further Thought
- **Causality** can help us map our thinking this summer
- Within tech. determinism, the utopian/dystopian binary persists
- Every major new technology has been talked in a utopian way
- Tech. Determinism is a **disempowering** perspective
- Social construction of technology emphasizes social processes
- Tech determinism and SCOT are **extreme** positions; many people's views are somewheree on the continuum
- Movies **reflect** what we are pondering as a society
