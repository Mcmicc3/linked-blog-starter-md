hey everybody Welcome to Unit 10 online information

0:07

distortions let's begin as we always do and we always have with your

0:13

announcements just one for today and that is that you have one remaining assignment in this course and that is

0:19

your end term exam why do I call it an end term exam instead of a final because

0:24

the end-term exam is not cumulative it only covers material since

0:30

the midterm this will be shorter than the midterm because it covers less material it is only 15 multiple choice

0:36

questions it is 10 true false questions you'll have one hour to do it it is of course open book and open note you can

0:43

use my slides you can use uh your notes as I said it only covers material

0:50

since the midterm it covers all unit recording since the midterm and all assigned readings and media are fair

0:57

game those assigned readings and media since the

1:03

midterm all right so couple of years ago a few years ago an interesting video came out from Mark

1:10

Zuckerberg of course we all know as the Creator owner of Facebook and meta let's

1:17

watch you I wish I could keep telling you that our mission in life is connecting people

1:24

but it isn't we just want to predict your future behaviors Spectre showed me how to

1:30

manipulate you into sharing intimate data about yourself and all those you love for free the more you express

1:37

yourself the more we own

1:42

you weird right okay of course that is not actually a video from Mark

1:48

Zuckerberg that is what is called a deep fake a kind of information Distortion

1:55

that we're going to discuss today I wish I could keep

2:01

and so we're going to conclude the course uh with a topic that is

2:07

concerning maybe even alarming for us but it's something that is important that we keep thinking about keep

2:13

pondering as we go forward with our digital lives and that is information

2:19

distortions of different kinds which we'll get into in this unit and their consequences why does it matter to us so

2:26

here's what we'll do we'll talk about five different kinds of information distortions some more than others in

2:33

this unit misinformation disinformation conspiracy theories deep

2:40

fakes Ai and social media and we'll end by discussing why we should

2:47

care okay information Distortion is really a term that can just be used as

2:54

an umbrella to cover all kinds of type

3:00

of distortions that we're talking about today it's an umbrella term the tendency of information communicated within and

3:07

between individuals and organizations to be altered omitted reorganized as it is

3:15

communicated the last part of this definition is important information distortions includes a range of

3:23

alterations from a simple error a mistake all way excuse me to deliberate

3:29

intentional prif in other words lies falsehoods that are deliberately put out

3:36

there in our in what we're interested in digital media to mislead confuse to

3:42

distort so information Distortion is an umbrella term beneath which can fit all

3:49

the different kinds of distortions that we'll be discussing in this unit it's also important to distinguish

3:56

between misinformation and disin information misinformation is the

4:02

sharing of inaccurate and misleading information but that sharing is

4:08

unintentional well not the sharing itself is unintentional but the fact that it is misleading and inaccurate is

4:15

unintentional it's a mistake mistakenly sharing information content that is

4:23

inaccurate or misleading false by contrast disinformation is intentional

4:29

the deliberate dissemination of false or fake or inaccurate information in order

4:36

to discredit a person or organization so misinformation is when

4:43

inaccuracies distortions are shared uh it's unintentional people don't know for

4:49

example that they're sharing a piece of content that is not real disinformation

4:54

is one that is done deliberately in order to discredit in some way either a person a politician a celebrity or an

5:05

organization here are some examples of information distortions and these ones happened a

5:12

couple years ago but it's good to use these because something called the news liter literacy project has actually

5:18

documented these and has verified that they're false and to show how so this

5:23

top image was a post that supposedly showed Donald Trump when he was president um wandering aimlessly uh on

5:31

the White House right so this person says mindlessly lumbering and zigzagging in the grass right so even even uh

5:40

invoking whether or not president Trump had dementia and so this is out of context

5:46

this does not show president Trump wandering and confusion it is a deceptively edited clip taken from a

5:53

video of trump walking away from reporters to wait for First Lady Lady excuse me ladia lady Melania

6:02

Trump now as to this person Tom whatever whether this was intentionally shared to

6:07

discredit Trump or was honestly shared as a as a this person thought that this showed Trump in a state of confusion we

6:14

don't know so we can't tell if it is misinformation or disinformation disinformation what it is however is an

6:21

example of information Distortion it's a picture it's a real picture but it's

6:27

taken and described used circulated out of

6:32

context this is simply a false claim that Biden wants to put a 3%

6:40

annual federal tax on your home this is simply fake false claim now whether or

6:46

not this person whose name is blurred out uh believe that this is real and circulated we don't know so again we

6:51

don't know if it's misinformation and disinformation but as the news literacy project mentions it was shared more than

6:57

4,000 times I wanted to see if this uh description

7:05

stated how many times it had been shared but it doesn't this is a an example of a

7:13

photograph that uh is presented out of context to create a lie and apparently

7:20

this Photograph was actually cited by a journalistic website BuzzFeed which of

7:26

course magnifies its damage that it can do when it's cited by when it's invoked

7:32

cited by a press Outlet so this image perpet on the left showed an

7:38

explosion in a Minneapolis Police Station this is in and around the times

7:44

of the protests in Minneapolis after the murder of George Floyd So this actually

7:49

did not this image is not of a an explosion inside a Minneapolis Police Station this is actually an explosion in

7:55

tianin a city in China which occurred several years before that so this is another example

8:02

of uh somebody creating this to deceive so that would be

8:07

disinformation this picture uh was circulated a few years

8:14

ago um and attributed by some including some blogs and at least a couple of news

8:19

outlets that was attributed to Japanese and Hong Kong news networks perpet

8:26

showing the presidents or the ruler of North Korea dead so King Jong-Un several

8:35

years ago just disappeared for a few weeks um we didn't hear from him uh we

8:41

understand now that he kind of does this thing from time to time probably I don't know know this for a fact but probably

8:47

to test the Loyalty of his people and his generals so this was an image purply

8:52

showing him as a corpse you know lying in state the the ruler of North Korea

8:58

and that was false it turns out it was actually a photoshopped image putting

9:05

Kim jongin's head on what was an image of his father Kim Jong ill lying in

9:12

state in 2011 and again so this this picture on the left uh was aligned with news

9:20

networks again magnifying the damage that this type of uh disinformation

9:26

which some people might share unknowingly misin information can do and then it's important to understand

9:34

what a conspiracy theory is conspiracy theory we can Define in

9:40

the following way an explanation of past present or future events or

9:46

circumstances so really an explanation of events at any time but the explanation involves a small group of

9:54

powerful individuals acting secretly to benefit themselves and against the common good

10:01

against the good of the rest of us so you probably know people who are

10:07

conspiracy theorists they're people who like to explain events oh these small

10:13

small group of people are acting to benefit themselves enrich themselves make themselves powerful and it's going

10:19

to screw all the rest of us that's what a conspiracy theory is this is an interesting quiz that the Washington

10:25

Post has if you want to follow this link uh please do when I post the slides and

10:31

that is a conspiracy theory quiz it turns out according to the Washington Post that eight or nine out of 10 people

10:38

in America actually believe in at least one conspiracy theory so if you go and

10:43

take that quiz you can see if you're one of the 90% of us who actually does believe in one conspiracy theory so

10:50

please feel free to do that for fun if you want here are some examples of conspiracy theories that 911 was a cover

10:59

perpetrated by George W bush the administration right so people pointed to the fact that you know um how was it

11:06

that the Twin Towers fell in such a particular way kind of pancaked in some

11:11

people say well it's not Engineering in in an engineering sense it's not possible for them to have fallen that

11:17

way if they were struck by a plane from above people use that kind of information to say that oh actually uh

11:23

this was an inside job 911 it wasn't uh terrorists predominantly from uh Saudi

11:30

Arabia but this was done by the administration of George W bush to then what justify wars in the Middle East and

11:36

so on that's a conspiracy theory Donald Trump and his supporters

11:43

assertion that the 20 uh 20 election was stolen by Democratic

11:52

operatives and Joe Biden is a conspiracy theory there is no real evidence to

12:00

support that claim in fact Trump's team tried to bring evidence to around 60

12:07

court cases and the judge threw them out or ruled against them in 59 I believe

12:14

out of 60 of those cases or thereabouts and the one that they did have some kind of verdict in their favor simply

12:20

involved the amount of space that The Observers had to leave you know to to watch the proceedings right they were

12:26

made to stand you know a little bit further back than maybe they could have been in other words there's no real

12:32

evidence that there was massive ballot fraud or anything close to that nature

12:37

conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from Trump is a conspiracy theory used number one for Trump to justify

12:45

losing and two to undermine the administration of Joe Biden here's

12:50

another conspiracy theory which is that JFK was not killed by Le Lee Harvey

12:55

Oswald but was actually killed by the CIA right so some people say it's impossible

13:02

that there could have been one loone shooter in Dallas Texas that day shooting from far away actually this was

13:08

an inside job by the CIA to get rid of JFK that's a conspiracy theory there's

13:13

all been all kinds of studies of the bullet trajectory that day and people claiming that you know it couldn't be

13:20

possible or it was possible another conspiracy theory is this idea that Princess Diana the mother

13:28

of har and William uh that Princess Diana who died

13:34

tragically uh in a tunnel in Paris after being chased by the Press uh

13:42

that that wasn't an actual car accident that that was arranged somehow by the

13:48

British royal family people say that for example it's well known that Princess

13:53

Diana and uh then Prince Charles now King Charles were splitting up

13:59

both were with other partners Princess Diana was dating someone named Dodie fiad and some people alleg that the

14:07

royal family arranged to have her taken care of that's a conspiracy

14:12

theory another one that I'm sure many of you have heard of is the qanon conspiracy theory and this is believed

14:20

unfortunately by thousands or tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands of Americans and people around

14:27

the world this is conspiracy theory that argues that there is a deep state of

14:34

democratic operatives and people who align with them including members of the FBI and the justice department and so

14:41

on who are actively working to subvert the real American leader and president

14:48

and hero Donald Trump and steal the country from the legitimate uh person Donald Trump and

14:57

steal the country to do bad things and oh yes by the way this deep state of

15:02

operatives are also satanic pedophiles who drank the blood of kids I'm not

15:08

exaggerating here that is a conspiracy theory of

15:13

qanon Believers just to give you more of a sense of what qanon is I'm sure some

15:19

of you have maybe even seen this documentary let's watch the preview for a show or documentary that HBO did on Q

15:26

andon called into the storm let's watch

15:44

anybody I'll show them Q proofs say look talk me out of it have you heard the Q

15:49

the what what had started in an online Forum

15:56

had crawled out from behind the screen to the seat of power all with the help of a single letter and

16:02

we're going to win big you just watch in 2018 I set out to chart Q's

16:10

Origins I wrote the first part of H while I was coming off of psychedelic

16:17

mushrooms you can really find yourself falling down a hole trying to find out who Q is I'm pretty sure Q is a spin-off

16:24

from Star Trek Q is whatever you want it to be sometimes they'll even think think it's me I have a question you're going

16:31

through a possible list of who Q might be that's right you're on the list well let's continue

16:39

then dangerous ideas that's a scary

16:45

idea people conspiracy theorize about things that they think are powerful what did we conspired against followers try

16:51

to discredit reporters because we're required to find out if it's true or not it seems like Q's gone mainstream they

16:57

don't care about other people dying the lunatics running the Asylum you can't expect to get counter punched we we have

17:03

to go we need to move game over this cute thing is just exponential growth I think people are worried it's

17:09

going to be used to radicalize more people do you think that that is

17:27

warranted okay so that is a preview for the HBO documentary Into the Storm which

17:33

looks into the Q andon phenomenon and conspiracy theory in my description of Q andon I forgot to mention who actually Q

17:40

is so as part of this story uh Q this conspiracy theory Q is supposedly a

17:48

patriot uh who is ostensibly part of the deep state but is actually working to

17:54

expose the Deep State and is on the side of the Patriots and Donald Trump Trump

17:59

who leaves Q drops or crumbs all over the internet as signs or clues for the

18:07

Believers of qanon to follow to unearth what is really happening this deep state

18:12

cabal of satanic

18:18

pedophiles one of the interesting things about conspiracy theories is that they are non-falsifiable it's really not

18:25

possible to prove them wrong or really effectively refute

18:30

them uh because people for example who say that 911 was an inside job will just

18:35

say that oh well okay the the administration of George W bush is just really good at hiding it well this is

18:40

just an effective aspect of the cover up so they insulate The Conspiracy

18:46

Theory from criticism by by by making them non-falsifiable okay you just

18:52

haven't looked hard enough for the right evidence or this is just excuse me another example of the incredible

18:58

ability of government to cover things up it tends to be non-falsifiable

19:03

here's an important caveat regarding digital media and conspiracy theories digital media did not create conspiracy

19:11

theories conspiracy theories have existed long before the internet in fact Hitler used a conspiracy theory an awful

19:19

evil one that the Jewish people were responsible for tanking the German economy and the Germans loss in World

19:26

War I in order to justify his maniacal evil idea for the

19:32

Holocaust and conspiracy theories have been you know used way back in fact interestingly enough um the Declaration

19:39

of Independence in the US was based in part on a conspiracy theory about what the king of England was apparently doing

19:45

to sabotage the colonies so digital media did not and do

19:51

not create conspiracy theories however they make they provide a forum where

19:58

conspiracy theories can be increasingly frequently

20:03

discussed and then there are deep fakes deep fakes which

20:10

are I wish I could keep telling you that our a specific kind of synthetic

20:17

media excuse me where a person in an image or video is swapped with another

20:24

person's likeness for fun let's rewat watch the

20:29

Zucker bird deep fake that I began this unit with I wish I could keep telling

20:34

you that our mission in life is connecting people but it isn't we just want to predict your future

20:41

behaviors Spectre showed me how to manipulate you into sharing intimate data about yourself and all those you

20:47

love for free the more you express yourself the more we own

20:55

you so deep fakes are a kind of uh disinformation and information

21:02

Distortion this one done to discredit Zuckerberg how do deep fakes work I'm

21:09

not somebody who's um that you know an expert on the technical side of of this type of computer science so I'll read a

21:17

couple of pieces of information about how the technology actually works a Creator creator of a deep fake swaps one

21:24

person's face and replaces it with another using a facial recognition

21:31

algorithm and a deep learning computer network called a variational auto

21:37

encoder this variational autoencoder or vae is then trained to encode images

21:43

into low dimensional representations and then decode those representations back

21:49

into images I'm not going to uh have any questions on the technical side here the

21:55

computer science of deep fakes but I wanted to include this for your own

22:01

interest few years ago a video from the uh prime minister of the

22:10

Netherlands uh purply came out with a video on YouTube about what real climate

22:18

change leadership looks like let's watch at least some of this

22:26

video L not

22:57

for

23:27

for is that

23:57

so for

24:29

all right I'll stop it there in the interest of time so this doesn't get too long um so of course this is not a real

24:37

statement from the prime minister of the Netherlands uh this is a deep

24:42

fake and so this is a kind of information Distortion this is um

24:49

disinformation there's an interesting kind of twist here though and that is this video raises the possibility that

24:56

deep fakes can also be used as part as part of social justice movements for

25:02

example the movement to demand climate Justice action against climate change we

25:07

could even consider this video to be part of participatory politics but nevertheless it is inaccurate it is

25:16

disinformation it is a deep

25:23

fake now let's talk about AI which we spoke at length about and how we can

25:29

theorize that from a communication perspective in the last unit but let's talk about Ai and social media and how

25:36

those kinds of efforts can be used to distort and

25:41

why that should be concerning to us and so let me draw in this discussion this particular discussion of AI from an

25:49

interesting article in a really quality publication called the Atlantic that came out uh fairly recently the headline

25:56

of that piece is AI is about to make social media much more toxic so the

26:03

author say generative AI the kind that can chat with you or make pictures you'd like to see generative AI is a type of

26:10

AI that creates content chat GPT is a kind of generative AI would likely

26:17

exacerbate social media's ills means make social media's ills worse making

26:23

social media more addictive more divisive and more manipulative

26:28

well how first of all according to this piece social media like Tik Tok like

26:36

Twitter or X like Facebook like Instagram social media will wash ever larger Torrance of garbage into our

26:43

public conversation muddy things up by unleashing Torrance of crap a lot of it

26:50

that which is distortions so the authors say propaganda doesn't have to convince

26:55

people in order to be effective the point is to overwhelm us the citizens

27:01

with interesting content that will keep us disoriented distrustful and

27:08

angry Illusions May soon become deeply woven

27:13

into normal life so we live already in a in a time when we're a wash with

27:21

information distortions it may not be one or several

27:26

pieces of particular content images stories memes that convince us or

27:33

persuade us it may be just the mere nature of there being so much crap out

27:40

there that it makes us confused disoriented distrust what we see

27:45

distrust what we see from historically quality or traditional news outlets and

27:52

angry here's an example of uh some distortions image distortions that was a

27:58

fake image of trump so is this one second reason why according to this

28:04

piece AI artificial intelligent is about to make social media much more toxic

28:09

according to these authors the widespread skillful manipulation of people by AI super

28:16

influencers including personalized influencers rather than by Ordinary People and dumb Bots other words we're

28:23

going to have influencers that are actually AI some people may realize there AI but still be cool with

28:29

following them some people may not even realize that they're AI they're not individual people human influencers they

28:36

AI

28:41

influencers this is kind of an example um that is consistent with this

28:48

idea there's a company called replica which for $300 can sell you an AI

28:54

companion that will be the man of your dreams who will never die argue or cheat

29:00

until his algorithm is updated so in this case people would willingly pay money uh to uh be communicated with by

29:10

this influencer this in this case man of your dreams I don't know if this company

29:15

also sells a woman of your dreams I would imagine they would but I don't know that a third reason according to this

29:22

piece why AI artificial intelligence is going to and probably already has made

29:28

social media more toxic has to do with young people

29:34

growing up adolescence teens Ai and social media is likely to

29:39

be a disaster for teenagers adolescence so according to the piece children are

29:45

the population most vulnerable to addictive and manipulative online platforms because of their High exposure

29:53

to social media they're on it all the time and the low level of development in their prefontal cour cortices so the

29:59

prefontal cortex is the part of our brain that is responsible for making decisions and for response inhibition

30:06

telling us when to respond and not when to respond for teens that ability is

30:12

still forming and so their com teens young

30:17

kids are more susceptible to social media and AI creating disinformation

30:24

misinformation distortions on so social media uh it's going to make everything

30:31

worse this is an interesting piece that kind of um elaborates on this point

30:37

according to this article one reason to explain Tik tok's success is due to its

30:43

algorithm that it pushes the boundaries in terms of what it thinks you know what's going to enrage people what it

30:49

thinks is going to get a reaction what's going to be like risque or shocking the Tik Tock Al algorithm pushes the

30:56

boundaries in in terms of what what it shows what Tik toks it shows people in what order and those kind of Tik toks

31:03

can be particularly uh impressionable to young people to teens to adolescents

31:09

whose brains are still developing and who live on their phones and on their social media platforms all the time a

31:16

fourth reason according to this Atlantic piece why AI is making social media much more toxic is that AI thinking about

31:24

this now from an international perspective and an international Rel relations perspective AI will strengthen

31:31

authoritarian regimes just as social media end up doing ended up doing despite its initial

31:38

promise as a democratizing force there's an interesting debate in the literature as to social media does it lead to more

31:44

de democracy or is it worse for democracy because for example authoritarian leaders can use it for

31:51

propaganda and can shut down social media platforms when they want to the authors of this piece argue that

31:57

AI already helping authoritarian authoritarian excuse me rulers track their citizens movement so surveil on

32:04

them spy on them but will also help them exploit social media more effectively to

32:10

manipulate their people as well as foreign enemies and so we know for example that Russia and to some degree

32:18

China already tries to use social media social media content to feed the us all

32:25

kinds of disinformation for for example about our elections it's a type of election interference using information

32:34

distortions another example is Tik Tok which is owned by a Chinese company apparently according to

32:42

this piece Washington Post creating an alternate universe just

32:47

for Russia its strategic Ally according to this piece the Chinese

32:54

owned social media giant Tik Tok muzzled its users

33:01

in Russia cutting them off from the outside world while allowing State

33:07

propaganda in other words allowing consent that towed the line Putin's you

33:14

know line about why he's invading Ukraine the war is still going uh in

33:20

terms of at least as of this um recording still going as of um as of now

33:28

and uh Putin saying that you know he's taking this military action to root out Nazis right or arguing that Ukraine has

33:35

always been a part of the Russian sphere of influence and therefore has no business being independent apparently

33:42

the Chinese own social media company Tik Tock China is an ally of Russia was allowing Putin's propaganda but

33:50

censoring or cutting out from being returned to people's feeds information from other parts of the world which

33:57

oppos Ed Putin's position on this conflict and may have adopted Ukraine's

34:03

position let's end this unit with a discussion of why we should care about

34:10

online information distortions why should we care or you know why these kind of distortions are just not you

34:16

know a novelty or something interest to discuss interesting to discuss in a vacuum but why these should be deeply

34:22

concerning to us with regard to society well first of all the presence

34:27

of filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers which we've discussed in this class and this book the filter bubble by Eli

34:33

Pariser we talked about Eli Pariser being an example of a skeptic of the

34:39

digital Revolution the filter bubble is a phenomenon where we are all in these

34:45

filter bubbles where the only information that really gets in because of algorithms is information that we

34:53

largely already agree with because the algorithms are giving us returns based

34:58

on what we've previously clicked and what our friends in our networks online

35:04

have clicked or liked or commented on so the only information that's filtering in

35:10

is usually information that we already align with information let's say trashing the other side politically

35:15

that's going to make us angry and keeping us more online don't forget we

35:21

also said well why would those algorithms be designed that way from the perspective of political economy it's

35:27

because that what keep us Keeps Us online on social media more that's how those companies make money by selling

35:35

advertising so information distortions conspiracy theories false stuff that

35:40

makes us angry or makes us laugh or make fun of the other side information

35:46

distortions come into our filter chamber leads to Echo Chambers means that people

35:52

within our networks all kind of echoing the same stuff that leads to further div vision

35:57

and political polarization and even radicalization people will say becoming mad or using violence uh because of what

36:06

they see that makes them so mad you know online so the presence of filter bubbles

36:11

in Echo Chambers is one reason we should be concerned about information distortions another reason to be

36:18

concerned is the nature of what we often

36:23

see online as we know not always but we can see participatory cultures

36:29

online for example one of the things that conspiracy theories like qanon do

36:34

is to directly engage participatory culture people contribute to these communities online where they're trying

36:41

to figure out what these Q drops are it's like solving a puzzle it's like a treasure

36:48

hunt so people want to engage in participatory culture except as we

36:54

talked about before participatory cultures don't always B benefit Society

36:59

sometimes it can be really destructive for example when they revolve around an

37:04

information Distortion Like a conspiracy theory these are other examples of uh of

37:12

Q drops these Clues and questions given to the Q andon Community again many many

37:19

hundreds of thousands of people around the world and arguably especially in the US pay attention to these C drops these

37:27

these Clues from this supposed Patriot is going to expose the Deep state so

37:32

people see this and want to engage Within These participatory cultures and communities the third reason why we

37:38

should be concerned about information distortions is that people's reactions to distortions for example when they

37:45

become Enga enraged angry even militant or violent reactions can easily move

37:53

from the online space to the offline space

37:58

and this happened in the attack on the US capital on January 6th

38:07

2021 people were radicalized online conspiracy theory that the election was

38:12

stolen from Donald Trump and violently attacked the capital kicking

38:20

beating Bears spraying cops and uh vandalizing and trying to destroy the

38:27

capital and stop the transfer of power another incident that happened specifically involves

38:35

qanon uh and one aspect of the whole Q andon conspiracy theory is that

38:41

um uh there are some places that are posing as regular businesses but are

38:48

actually uh pedophile rings and so there was a North Carolina

38:54

man who thought that a specific pizza shop in DC was a uh a pedophile ring and not

39:01

really a pizza shop drove to DC and threatened people with a gun and was then convicted and sent to jail so the

39:09

kind of rage and anger that can result from online conspiracy communities

39:15

communities that center around distortions disinformation make people mad and raged angry that kind of

39:23

violence those reactions can actually move from online to

39:30

offline nearly four in 10 people who say the election was stolen from Trump a

39:35

conspiracy theory say violence may be needed to save

39:41

America a fourth reason why it's important for us to

39:47

understand the threat that these information distortions pose to our society is that information distortions

39:53

can increase distrust that people have in societ take a look at this uh well

39:59

first of all this screenshot um where uh Trump supporters were often

40:07

told that news coverage Washington Post LA Times New York Times were fake news

40:12

CNN people then start to distrust the press the media journalists

40:20

generally now take a look at this chart from pew pew Research Center that shows

40:26

that a line in trust that Americans have trust in government over the last

40:34

several decades since 1960 and this is important when you think about the starting point here

40:39

because the decline in trust begins really Kennedy is assassinated LBJ takes

40:46

over but it comes out that the US government was lying to us about their

40:51

what they knew about how the war in Vietnam was going we understand that through something called the release of the Pentagon paper

40:58

then you had Watergate scandal with Nixon so trust starts declining it picks up uh it you know around the time of 911

41:06

and uh people start to trust the government declines more and more right so we've already have this declining

41:13

level that people have in trust for the government made even worse by

41:18

information distortions that are flooding us now online and the fifth reason why we

41:24

should really understand the nature of the threats of information distortions threat to society relates to just kind

41:31

of exactly the kind of climate we live in right now which some schol Scholars have argued is the arrival of the

41:38

posttruth era and what can be understood as the unreal which you're reading dealt

41:44

with what is the unreal according to the scholar zuckman an approach to politics that forsakes or gets rid of or

41:52

dispenses with interpretation of a common set of facts so it's like idea that we no longer as Citizens and

42:00

Americans believe in a common set of facts in favor of creating closed

42:05

universes of mutually reinforcing facts and interpretations so for example people

42:13

who watch one Amer news or Fox News Prime Time versus people who listen to

42:19

democracy Now on the left or watch MSN MSNBC Prime Time not only do those news

42:25

organizations frame stories in different ways which has been the case throughout

42:30

American history and the and the press and politics but they are cultivating whole

42:37

new universes of mutually reinforcing facts so for example Fox News may not

42:44

even report a story in the evening I'm talking about their Prime Time lineup may not even report stories that don't

42:52

reinforce their version of reality MSNBC could do a similar thing

42:57

so people aren't living in a world in which they are subject to the same set of facts people are living in closed

43:04

universes of different interpretation and mutually reinforcing facts this is another Atlantic piece

43:12

that argues we already living in the posttruth era the era after

43:17

truth this is um a story that revolved around uh when the when Kate Middleton

43:24

uh Princess Kate Middleton uh released doctored images to the public it turns out we later learned

43:31

that she was dealing with cancer diagnosis and treatment so this piece makes the

43:37

argument that it's not even about seeing one specific fake image it's just knowing and seeing them becoming

43:44

becoming them a normal regular part of our information ecosystem they affect our minds when we

43:51

are a wash in so much Distortion including deep Fates and many of the other examples we talked about in this

43:58

unit so the post truth era signifies the

44:03

subordination of factual or objective arguments to personal beliefs and emotion in other words what is factual

44:10

or objective is pushed down is secondary is less important to what we or People Like Us

44:17

believe and our emotions in a pop uh excuse me in a

44:23

post-truth era pop culture media content and coverage and interpersonal communication for

44:29

example chatting with people in social media come together or converge to create perceptions of reality that

44:36

become more real than reality itself we need look no further than how different

44:42

people different groups think about Donald Trump so perceptions of reality become more real than reality itself in

44:50

Our post- Truth era which you can strongly make the argument that we are already in the post truth era

44:57

let's conclude this unit and this course with some conclusions and final thought regarding this unit specifically well

45:05

first of all our jobs as Scholars is to understand how artificial intelligence

45:11

and conspiracy theories and distortions uh can be of concern and can

45:18

harm Society because as Scholars we tend to look at things that may need our

45:23

attention that may be worrisome but there are however beneficial uses of AI

45:29

and even of conspiracy theories what do I mean well AI is used for example in

45:34

our Google search returns or to help us uh in our customer service interactions

45:39

with a brand when you use a chat bot or AI is used for example to be able to comb through millions of pages of

45:46

pharmaceutical studies to identify relevant results to make it clearer which type of drugs which testing

45:53

conditions are uh better than others or are more effective than others so there are beneficial uses of

45:59

AI and even of conspiracy theories how do I mean that well conspiracy theories are a way for some people to try to make

46:07

sense of the World when they find the world confusing and even scary so

46:12

sometimes people use conspiracy theories to help them feel okay with things they can't

46:20

explain here's something that is concerning according to Pew data 8 86%

46:27

of Americans either often or sometimes get their news online smartphone computer or

46:34

tablet what does that mean that means that oftentimes what they think is news is actually information distortions

46:41

misinformation or disinformation platforms Tik Tok

46:47

Facebook Twitter Instagram have no real interest in deterring myth or

46:55

disinformation why is that don't they care the answer to that again we have to think about our

47:00

political economy perspective the answer is because they know that stuff that makes us

47:07

angry and stuff that makes us for example hate the other side is going to make us stay online and click more which

47:14

then makes them able to build more effective models and sell more advertising and make more

47:21

money digital media did not create information distortions right so back in

47:27

the day when there used to be a town choir or used to rely on a human to go from group to group to relay a news

47:33

story to relate something that's happened in another social grouping well that information wasn't relayed 100%

47:39

accurately it was distorted so digital media did not create information distortions however there is much more

47:47

exponentially more opportunities for them to occur because of digital media one of our main concerns in this

47:55

area is that our internet communities are increasingly polarized because in

48:01

part of information distortions we see stuff that is false fake conspiracy theories makes us mad

48:09

enraged makes us angry and makes us hate the other side polarization of Internet

48:16

communities in part because of filter bubbles Echo Chambers and what feeds them like distortions is a major

48:23

concern the danger of conspiracy theories is on online but also offline

48:28

as we've seen from the examples of the terror attacks on January

48:34

6th and the example of the person who uh brandished a gun in the pizza shop in

48:40

DC conspiracy theories and the anger that they produce can move offline into

48:46

the real world so there is a real world danger here we can end this with a little bit

48:54

of positivity that I won't go into uh in much detail that is to say however that there are things that can be done and

49:01

maybe you all as you go forward can be one of the leaders in thinking of things that can be done to make information

49:10

distortions less prevalent less impactful and generally to make digital

49:15

culture better and less harmful and the primary thing that I can

49:20

think of is digital literacy the need to teach young people about yes the

49:27

benefits and positives of social media and being online but also about some of the dangers whether that is cyber

49:33

bullying conspiracy theories misinformation disinformation so we've got to as a

49:41

society think about warning labels that can be put on Sometimes some Societies in some countries are trying to ban

49:47

social media use up until a certain age or european count is playing with that now there are things that can be done

49:55

even if the social media platform are unwilling or unable to police

50:00

themselves there are things like better parenting better information digital

50:06

literacy whether that it's classes in schools that are become required classes there are things that we can do and I

50:13

hope that you all will be some of the people who think about and put into

50:19

action ways that we can make our digital lives better and that will conclude this unit

50:24

thank you very much for listening and for watching
