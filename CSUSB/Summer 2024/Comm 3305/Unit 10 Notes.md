Conspriacy theories **non-falsifiable**: it is difficult to refute a conspiracy theory and show that there is not one avoiding detection

The use of digital media does **not** create conspiracy theories 

**BUT** conspiracy theories are increasingly discussed using digital media

## Deep Fake
"A specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped with another person's likeliness"

## How do deep fakes work?
Creator swaps one person's face and replaces it with another, using a facial recognition algorithm and a deep learning computer network called a variational auto-encoder 

VAEs are trained to encode images into low-dimensional representations and then decode those representations back into images

"Generative AI - the kind that can chat with you or make pictures you'd like to see - would likely exacerbate social media's ills, making it more addictive, divisive, and manipulative"
![[Pasted image 20240701235251.png]]

1. "Social media will wash ever-larger torrents of garbage into our public conversation"

"Propaganda doesn't have to convince people in order to be effective; the point is to overwhelm the citizenry with interesting content that will keep them disoriented distristful, and angry...

Illusions, historically in the realm of curiosities, may soon become deeply woven into normal life"

![[Pasted image 20240701235349.png]]

2. "The widespread, skillful manipulation of people by AI super-influencers- including personalized influencers - rather than by ordinary people and "dumb" bots."

![[Pasted image 20240701235432.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240701235438.png]]

3. "The further integration of AI into social media is likely to be a disaster for adolescents."

" Children are the population most vulnerable to addictive and manipulative online platforms because of their high exposure to social media and the low level of development in their prefrontal  cortices (the part of the brain most responsible for executive control and response inhibition)"

![[Pasted image 20240701235547.png]]

4. "AI will strengthen authoritarian regimes, just as social media ended up doing despite its initial promise as a democratizing force."

"AI is already helping authoritarian rulers track their citizens' movements, but it will also help them exploit social media far more effectively to manipulate their people - as well as foreign enemies"

# Why should we care about online info distortions?

1. Filter bubbles and echo chambers
" Leads to polarization and even radicalization!"

![[Pasted image 20240702000011.png]]

2. Participatory Culture

4. Can increase distrust

Is he connecting conspiracy theories with the growing distrust in the government?

5. Arrival of the "unreal" and the post-truth era?

## The Unreal
"An approach to politics that forsakes interpretation of a common set of facts in favor of creating closed universes of mutually reinforcing facts and interpretations"

![[Pasted image 20240702000446.png]]

## Post-Truth Era
Signifies the subordination of factual or objective arguments to personal beliefs and emotion

Popular culture, media content and coverage, and interpersonal communication converge to create **perceptions of reality** that become **more "real"** than reality itself

# Conclusions and further thought
- There are beneficial uses AI and even of CT!
- 86% people sometimes/often get news from get their news from smartphones, computer or tablet! (pew, 2023)
- Platforms have no real interest in deterring misinformation!
- Digital media did not create information distortions!
- But the polarization of internet communities is a central issue
- The danger of conspiracy theories is offline **AND** online
- There **ARE** things that **CAN** be done!
