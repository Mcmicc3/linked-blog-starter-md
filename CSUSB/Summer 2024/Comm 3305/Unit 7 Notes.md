Many scholars: **Race is socially constructed**

1) Americans embraced the idea of race to make slavery feel okay

3) Once upon a time, some people from Europe were "not quite white"

### Racialize
A process in which we **race** others in our mind's eye. **giving** them a **label** that corresponds or contrasts with the one we give ourselves. 

### Interprellation
We derive our sense of identtiy frmo how we respond to the ways in which **others implicitly categorize us** through public speech and gestures each day

## 3 type of interprellation

### Non-interpellation
Feeling *ignored* or *nonexistent*

### Negative Interpellation
Feeling **uncomfortably noticed** and **made visible**

### Mis-interpellation
Understanding of the self to be included in a definition of *everybody* and later addressed in a way that make it clear that they **are not**

## White invisibility
Whites are reminded of their race far less frequently than others; whites have the privilege to render themselves **raceless**

- Whites can assume they are race **neutral** only those who are members of **minority groups**
- **Invisibility** has distinct advantages for *whites* e.g. **deny the advantages their whiteness brings**

## Analyzing Online Race
1. Racism online operates in obvious **and** subtle ways ![[Pasted image 20240626233336.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240626233425.png]]

2. The default assumption of the internet is non-raced (White)
![[Pasted image 20240626233614.png]]
3. The presence of digitally circulated "*cybertypes*"
![[Pasted image 20240626233658.png]]

4. **BUT** race can be a powerful way of organizing communitites (both to oppress and resist/find community)

Black Twitter
A public group of specific twitter users who choose not to pass, but prioritize the performance of their racial identity

5. Participatory politics can be used to invite **expressions of emotional solidarity** with those who are suffering

## Racial Micro-aggression
The automatic and often unconsciously uttered insults and dismissals routinely directed toward people of color

6. HUMOR can be powerful, e.g. in making content "spread"

Things make us laugh because:
- THey help us feel superior to others
- They dispaly unexpectedness or weirdness
- They correspond to a sense of place and history
- They provide relief in socially tense environements

## Gender: BACKGROUND and KEYCONCEPTS

**Sex** is distinct from **gender**
- **Sex**, the biological state that corresponds to a "man" or a "woman" (BUT even this can be interpreted as socially constructed!)
- **Gender**: the *social understanding* of how sex should be experienced and how sex manifests in behavior, personality, preferences, capabilities, etc.

Assuming genders lol 

**Gender** is a system of classifications that *values male*-gendered things **more** than **female-related** things

### Male Normativity
The "universalized" male body and experienced is often constructed as average or normal, while female=gendered experiences are conceptualized as variations from the norm 


![[Pasted image 20240627164254.png]]

**Normative** gender behavior is that which adheres to the dominant understanding of masculine men and feminine women.
![[Pasted image 20240627164319.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240627172115.png]]
Non-normative behavior does not follow these social scripts

![[Pasted image 20240627173056.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240627173129.png]]

## Sexuality: BACKGROUND and KEY CONCEPTS

### Sexuality:
An individual expression and understanding of **desire**

### Heteronormativity
The **presumption** of **heterosexuality** unless explicitly stated otherwise

Values some expereinces as **normal** or **natural**, while **stigmatizing** others as *pathological* or *deviant*


![[Pasted image 20240627173231.png]]

### Sexuality (like *Gender*) is often viewed as a binary, but it is **not**

"QUEER" can be used as an umbrella terms for non-normative expressions of sexuality

Dominant discourses around sexuality (and gender) often view sec (and gender) as **fixed**, **unchanging**, intimately **intertwined**, and based on **biology**

## Analyzing online Gender and Sexuality
1. Social technologies **themselves** can be loaded with assumptions about gender and sexuality

![[Pasted image 20240627173613.png]]

2. Are the expressions of gender and sexuality online infleucned by the technology being used, tje
