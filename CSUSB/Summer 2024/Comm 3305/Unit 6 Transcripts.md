hey everybody Welcome to unit six online identity let's begin with a couple of

0:07

announcements uh well first of all discussion response three is due this Thursday at 11:59 p.m. and your midterm

0:16

exam is on Monday uh that is next Monday this coming Monday uh that is 10 true false

0:23

questions 20 multiple choice questions you'll have 60 Minutes to do it you can take it starting as ear early as 8:00

0:31

a.m. you must submit by 11:59 p.m. of course once you start it um you have to

0:37

complete it in one sitting um it is open book and open note you can use your slides the posted PDF of my slides you

0:43

can use your notes of course it is individual work only today we're going to transition to

0:51

an important section of the course which is all about identity and online

0:57

identity um so today uh we're going to be talking about how to unpack the

1:02

concept of identity first of all just identity generally and then we'll focus more narrowly on online identity and how

1:11

we construct our online identities there's a really important reading that goes along with this unit so please make

1:18

sure that you read that so our class plan for today is to First just unpa the

1:24

concept of identity in general offline online uh before we narrow down to

1:30

thinking about identity online on the internet we'll talk about this idea of

1:36

the internet as identity Workshop which didn't come to pass and then we'll focus

1:41

more narrowly into how we construct our identity online different approaches to

1:46

it how identity constructions varies we'll talk then about the concept of

1:52

difference the way that we think about different aspects of our identity and that is going to be inherently critical

1:59

because when you talk about difference you're talking about one group one group's characteristics over another

2:05

group then we're talking about problems with maintaining online identity in the

2:11

concept of context collapse okay so let's think now just

2:17

about the concept of identity generally whether that's offline online um the way

2:23

that we think about what it is to understand identity in general

2:30

if you want to hit pause and think to yourself how would you answer this questioni am what without thinking about

2:38

studying identity from a scholarly perspective if you haven't yet in another class this is your introduction

2:45

to it at this starting point what would you say how would you fill in the blanks

2:50

to this statement I am what if you want to hit pause now please feel free to

2:56

here's how we can Define identity this definition comes from communication theory.org simply the definition of

3:03

oneself frames of reference by which people perceive

3:09

themselves okay this highlights one understanding of identity but not all of

3:14

them the definition of oneself frames of reference by which people perceive themselves so that's that's kind of a

3:22

common understanding of identity that CRS that cuts across disciplines

3:27

academic disciplines well we construct identity by some

3:34

connection of these following factors language sometimes that is called

3:39

discourse the language that we use when we communicate with other people through social structures like

3:47

the influence of our families on our identity our friend networks our

3:55

roommates right our romantic Partners these are all social structures that

4:00

influence how we understand our own identity gender

4:06

orientation is an important aspect of identity and identity construction and

4:12

we'll talk about a little bit further in this unit how many scholars argue that gender is socially constructed a very

4:19

different view than the one espoused by Dave Chappelle In that clip we watched for the previous unit identity is also

4:26

constructed through cultural patterns culture means means shared understandings Norms attitudes values of

4:34

a particular group whether that group is based on geography like the particular

4:39

culture that we have in the Inland Empire or in SoCal versus nor NorCal for example but culture can also be based on

4:46

Urban or rural based on ethnicity and race uh based on

4:53

gender based on sexual orientation or attitude toward uh fluidity

4:59

so culture is all about shared attitudes norms and values so cultural

5:06

patterns shared views among certain groups are also important with regard to

5:13

how we construct our identity in life now when we think about this topic

5:22

in our discipline of communication including applying the topic of identity to digital spaces we are often going to

5:30

use a critical perspective now some of you may have studied critical

5:36

theory um Scholars will be sometimes

5:42

more rooted in critical theory so other Scholars less rooted in established

5:49

critical theory but usually when we think about identity and difference we're going to

5:55

be taking either a very strong or still present but less strong critical

6:01

perspective in other words criticizing um understandings of

6:06

identity particularly those that emphasize difference what do we mean when we say the critical perspective

6:12

well critical Scholars and myself am not one I study strategic political communication including on digital

6:20

spaces however I love teaching critical theory I teach that in my 3102 class

6:25

media culture and Society but we have several Scholars our department who are critical theorists so

6:33

the critical perspective is really important when it comes to the study of identity what does the critical

6:38

perspective entail it means a focus on power power and that's come up in several of our units already power is

6:46

all about the ability to influence other people other

6:51

groups power can come in a variety of forms it can come through force or by

6:57

might or by military power power can come through uh money finances through

7:04

economics in international relations sanctions power can come through

7:09

influence or the power of attraction or example which would explain why for example online influencers are

7:16

influential because they have the power of of uh of Attraction and the power of

7:21

um of people wanting to emulate them to be like them so the critical perspective

7:27

often focuses on matters of power power and inequality how power is spread

7:33

unequally throughout Society dominant groups in society often traditionally

7:40

males whites heterosexuals have often enjoyed more power in Western societies

7:48

uh in Western democracies than other groups for example than people of color or lgbtq

7:55

plus people and third the critic perspective is often focused on social change social

8:03

change here means how we can do something about this state of inequality

8:08

that is observed by critical Scholars so in this class we're not going to

8:14

dedicate ourselves to critical theory per se and when I say critical theory I'm of

8:20

course talking about um the frankort School Scholars and I'm talking about um

8:27

Michelle Fuko and well-known critical Scholars if you've heard some of those terms but we we will need to understand

8:37

and think about identity with somewhat of a critical perspective because when

8:42

we think about identity we'll see this at the end of this unit we're going to need to think about

8:48

difference okay let's talk more about this concept of identity generally

8:53

whether online whether offline well one way to think about identity is to distinguish between personal and social

9:01

identity and the terms here are intuitive right are straightforward

9:06

personal identity is what personally distinguishes us as individuals from

9:12

others so I could think about my unique qualities that that distinguish me as a

9:18

person from other humans that's my personal identity we also have social

9:24

identity social identity is what defines us as members of a particular particular

9:31

group so if you think about students at CSUSB you all have and

9:38

some of you there's a couple people joining from other institutions you all have personal identities the

9:44

characteristics that make you distinguishable from other people even other people at your same institution

9:50

like CSUSB but you have a social identity the most common one that unites us is that

9:55

we were all members of a university community and most of us the CSUSB

10:01

Community that's an aspect of our social

10:06

identity social identity in other words what defines us as members of a group

10:12

instead of as individuals can be voluntary or involuntary well in the case of being a a member of

10:19

CSUSB um you can say that you have voluntarily it's not mandatory required

10:24

by law to go to college right so it is voluntary you voluntarily become um

10:30

adopted at least in part ACS USB social

10:36

identity and uh hopefully that you all will graduate in which case that's

10:42

another aspect of your social identity of a college graduate social identity

10:47

can also be involuntary for example when one is assumed to be or act in a certain way

10:57

just because you are a member of a certain group group so I can use myself in as an example and I'll do that quite

11:02

a bit throughout this unit meaning using myself as an example in my online presence well I can say I'm half I'm a

11:09

person of mixed race and I'm half asian Indian so I could say that uh oftentimes

11:15

people make assumptions about Asian immigrant families Asian Indian South Asian East Asian Indian in terms of

11:22

being the model immigrant family like you most many people assume people who are uh Asian of Asian descent South

11:30

Asian descent is the the the type of Asian descent I most know about to be doctors or Engineers to be very

11:37

studious very good at math and science right well you can imagine somebody who

11:43

is let's say an artist who is of uh South Asian descent or just Asian descent in general well sometimes they

11:49

have to really um strive to establish a separate identity a personal identity that is separate or a new social

11:56

identity that is separate from the one that is involuntary the one that has assumed that you are an engineer or a

12:03

doctor that you're very good and only concerned with stem subjects science and math for

12:09

example so one way to think about identity is to distinguish our personal identity from our social identity which

12:16

can be voluntary or involuntary another way to think about identity and this is particularly important with regard to

12:23

our concern in this class is an understanding of identity that is

12:28

disembodied disembodied identity is an identity in

12:33

which the self is separated from our physical

12:39

bodies so online we all have at least one and sometimes more than one

12:44

disembodied identities we have profiles online on social media in video game

12:52

communities identities that are separate from our actual physical bodies that is

12:57

called a disembodied identity we can also observe three types

13:05

of identity first of all we can observe identity that is subjective or based on

13:13

subjectivity that is identity that consists of how we think about ourselves

13:19

how we think about ourselves right we all understand ourselves in certain ways

13:24

creative you know business oriented good at sports

13:29

don't care at all about sports um we we think about ourselves in

13:35

a certain way and that's one type of identity which is a subjective one how

13:43

we think about ourselves another type of identity is related to

13:51

representation which is something that is really important in media studies uh

13:57

those Scholars who study TV shows and movies to understand how different

14:03

facets of identity are depicted in media and in

14:09

culture so it's really important for example to understand how certain groups

14:15

particularly historically underrepresented groups are represented when they do gain visibility in

14:22

media to give just one example since I've already been talking about myself in my background I recently I saw a

14:28

movie called um uh called monkey man which is notable

14:33

because to my knowledge it is the first action movie uh mainstream action movie for you

14:41

know geared towards the US release instead of Bollywood in which the characters are mostly Asian

14:48

Indian and you have an Asian Indian lead in an action movie that has not been

14:54

typically seen in movies and so it's really important how the filmm makers represent that

15:01

character so representation through culture and media of identity is another

15:07

type of understanding of identity these are two more examples uh

15:14

that deal with media representation uh and um the first comes

15:20

from a really popular TV show that aired on Showtime They tried to bring it back

15:26

recently but it's Heyday was uh many years ago on Showtime called the LW the LW was important in media studies

15:34

because it was the first time that on Prime Time cable or TV you the plot

15:42

revolved around Young upwardly mobile lesbian women and followed their lives

15:47

in a major US city so it was in important in terms of visibility and yet the manner in which

15:54

those women were represented on this Showtime hit show was problematic according to Scholars

16:00

because it often depicted those characters as been essentially obsessed with sex and jumping around from bed to

16:07

bed that kind of stereotyped understanding of young lesbians um was a

16:13

common theme in that so a similar Point can be made about the NBC hit show Will and Grace which some of you have seen

16:20

again they tried to reboot that show because we live in a media environment where everything that worked before is

16:25

reborn and remade because that's seen as safe bet to make money well Will and Grace was notable in terms of visibility

16:32

because that hit show many years ago was the first Prime Time network TV sitcom

16:39

to feature a main character who is gay and yet critics have often pointed to

16:47

problems with Will and Grace uh because of the way that the gay

16:53

characters in that show were represented the way that gay identity was represented in that show

16:59

for example placing the main gay character I believe the character's name was Jack in the bottom left uh in

17:07

scenarios and dating situations that were actually heteronormative normative

17:12

heteronormative instead of placing them within nuanced understandings of gay

17:18

culture and gay dating culture so these are examples of how

17:25

sometimes identity representation can be important the fact that they're made visible but also

17:32

problematic if done in stereotyped ways and the third type of

17:39

identity revolves around self-presentation here not how we think

17:45

of ourselves that was the first kind but rather how we present ourselves to

17:51

others self-presentation and it is this third type of identity that we are most

17:57

concerned about in this class okay uh we are concerned about how

18:04

people present themselves to others online in other words their

18:09

self-presentation in digital spaces that's our main concern given our subject matter of digital

18:19

platforms speaking of that third understanding of identity which is self-presentation how

18:27

people present themselves to others there was an interesting school of

18:32

thought when the internet was first becoming widespread that the internet would serve

18:38

as a kind of identity workshop for people with regard to uh

18:45

self-representation people thought in the early days when the internet was becoming widespread that people would be

18:52

able to adopt play around with experiment with different identities and

18:59

that would lead to new understandings and new senses of of Liberation and

19:05

freedom that could occur especially among people who felt previously um

19:10

isolated or shy or um you know sort of not able to express

19:17

Express themselves freely and this was a famous um New Yorker cartoon that was

19:24

published in 1993 you can see the caption there on the internet nobody knows you're a dog

19:29

and that kind of cartoon has become the kind of understanding the symbolic

19:35

understanding of what some people thought about the internet back then that you could on the internet really

19:40

just play with experiment with identity and oftentimes overcome some of the negative aspects that culture May uh

19:49

associate with some parts of identity or some

19:56

identities so some Scholars then said that communication without traditional identity cues for

20:04

example being able to see somebody's face might enable people to experiment

20:11

with different identities and personalities making it obvious that these

20:16

categories meaning certain categories of identities were for example gender and

20:24

yes even race were actually social constructions so there was a kind of Hope among

20:32

Scholars of Technology at that time that the internet may lead to

20:38

people being able to experiment with different identities and in so doing would in a sense prove that what a lot

20:46

of Scholars had been arguing that certain types of identity were actually socially constructed they're not

20:52

inherent socially constructed gender race for example

20:59

because people would be able to sort of leave those identities and adopt new ones and that would lead to a whole new

21:05

understanding of what difference really even was and the causes of that being socially constructed instead of inherent

21:13

for example the communication that happened on Internet relay chat uh pages

21:18

and forums but that thought from some Scholars that

21:27

this so-called dismod communication would free Society from diff

21:32

discrimination because people could experiment with new identities and in so doing show that assumptions that people

21:39

make based on certain aspects of identities were actually socially constructed and not a fact of

21:46

life those changing understandings would make discrimination Less in society that

21:53

was a kind of hopeful and yes even utopian

21:59

understanding and expectation of the internet back then that did not come to

22:05

pass so why is it that the

22:13

internet just give me a second I want to make sure that I am

22:18

recording yes I am why is it that the internet as

22:25

identity Workshop did not happen why is it that it did not

22:32

happen well first of all people did not create radically different selves

22:40

online turns out that people's experimentation with with

22:45

identity uh was not as widespread as originally thought by these early utopian Scholars people did not create

22:53

radically different selves online moreover it became clear C that

22:59

discrimination is not solely based on physical appearance discrimination can

23:06

be based on for example assumptions made about certain words used or certain

23:12

emojis used or syntax used online or emojis or uh avatars used so

23:21

discrimination we've come to understand is not solely based on the physical appearance of a human can also be based

23:28

on communication style including icons and digital tokens that people use

23:34

online and third that and this is an interesting One commercial

23:41

software often steers us to a single fixed identity rather than actually

23:49

offering a multiplicity of choices why because when you as was the

23:57

case in the early days of of Internet platforms that offered only a choice

24:02

when it came to gender for male and female it became easier for them to

24:08

categorize data build models of people like certain users and sell those

24:16

information anonymized but still models built to advertisers to sell

24:22

advertising so it turns out that commercial software often tried to steer

24:27

people not to be able to experiment with identity but towards a single fixed

24:32

identity it's easier easier for them to classify data build models and use those

24:38

data to sell advertising and make money so this utopian idea that the internet

24:45

was going to provide a kind of identity workshop for people to experiment with

24:50

different identities bre themselves from stigmatization and

24:56

stereotyping uh and in that process would show that the way

25:01

that we categorize some people neatly based on certain differences those were

25:06

socially constructed and not inherently valid that utopian understanding of what

25:13

the work the internet might lead to did not come to

25:18

pass all right now let's talk more specifically about identity construction

25:23

online

25:32

let's look at different approaches to Identity construction the first is to

25:37

think about the construction of identity now remember we're specifically now talking about identity online and

25:43

constructing identity online one way to think about identity construction online

25:50

is to understand identity as fixed or static not changing unchanging

25:58

to give you an example from myself this is a part of my faculty profile at

26:05

CSUSB to understand my identity in this digital space as fixed would be to

26:11

understand that there is this person an assistant professor of

26:18

communication uh who has certain qualities teach certain classes has a

26:23

certain background it doesn't change unless you you might say a class

26:29

or two is added or subtracted but the basic parameters of this person a certain title at an

26:35

institution doesn't change identity as fixed or static another approach to Identity

26:43

construction is very different and that one is to think about identity online as

26:48

not fixed but actually as flexible and changeable something that can be altered

26:56

to suit search online contexts and also can change

27:04

significantly from this approach it may be noted that people present themselves

27:10

differently based on context where they are online for example

27:17

on um Tik Tok versus where it's mostly

27:22

younger folks versus on Facebook where many users are older or for young adults

27:30

they're for example Aunts Uncles grandparents maybe so people present themselves

27:35

differently based on contacts where they are online and audience who they are

27:42

with and so for example your online profile as a student may be

27:48

very different than your online profile at work or just among your

27:55

friends here's an example from my online presence which is very different from

28:01

the one I just showed you and probably different to what you may expect uh your professor's online identity to

28:09

be so from this approach my identity is flexible and changeable based on context

28:14

and audience that means that I can have this identity as a faculty member at

28:21

CSUSB but I can also for different

28:26

communities with different audiences different people viewing my content I can also have

28:33

this type of identity so my overall online identity is flexible and

28:39

changeable according to what platform I'm on and who my expected audience is

28:46

am I just posting where friends could see or am I posting where my fellow

28:51

faculty members can see or my students or maybe older members of my family so

28:57

identity flexible and changeable is another approach Scholars say that multiplicity meaning having multiple

29:04

aspects of identity is inherent to Identity rather

29:12

than dishonest or fake because there are some people who think that when people have different aspects of their identity that

29:19

they do change their identity online their identity can be flexible very

29:25

different on Tik Tok versus Instagram versus Facebook there are some critics

29:31

who'd say that that shows dishonesty or being fake when actually Scholars say

29:39

that that type of Multiplicity having multiple facets of identity is actually

29:44

an inherent property of identity meaning it's part of in identity in and of

29:50

itself actually online and offline right offline we have multiplicity in our

29:56

identity too think about going to let's say a concert with your friends versus going to a meeting with your boss you so

30:05

identity is is has different facets has

30:10

multiplicity and then the third approach to understanding identity construction

30:17

online is to view that online identity is constructed socially constructed

30:24

through discourse communication and social processes

30:29

so this is a third approach to thinking about online identity as socially

30:35

constructed through communication between people and

30:40

social excuse me I hit mute there for a second so constructed through discourse

30:46

and social processes so can look back at my CSUSB identity but we can understand

30:54

that there are aspects of my CSUSB identity which are socially constructed

30:59

for example with you calling me Professor or for example when we uh when

31:08

I am emailing a student and other faculty members are on that same email

31:14

chain what do your faculty often do we refer to other faculty members as

31:20

doctor right um as Dr johnon said you should be expecting this document in the

31:27

near future well I don't call that imaginary person Dr Johnson when I'm just chatting to

31:33

them in their office right in this case an aspects or aspects of University

31:42

identity are constructed through social processes the understandings of respect that is

31:50

expected that students for example show faculty members and through discourse through how we communicate that

31:56

including a signature block with your qualifications for us faculty

32:01

it's comma PhD that is part of construction of identity through

32:08

discourse and through social process and when you graduate uh you'll forever be comma ba

32:15

or BS and when you put that on your card uh or on your desk or in your signature

32:22

block on an email that'll be part of the way that you are socially constructing your identity

32:29

online many scholars in contrast to what Dave Chappelle said in the clip we

32:34

watched for the last unit view that gender and yes even race are socially

32:41

constructed and are performed rather than existing in and of

32:47

themselves and we'll look at some more examples U of um of how race can be understood as socially constructed in a

32:54

in the next unit um SC uh Scholars who would argue that

33:02

gender and race are socially constructive and performative would also knowe that gender and race as they are

33:08

constructed through culture Society media social processes hierarchies they

33:15

are ideological done to maintain or further a particular balance of power

33:22

now here is where you get a clear understanding of the critical lens that scholar often take to unpack

33:31

identity right because to note that understandings of the way that for example gender or even race are socially

33:39

constructed not existing According to some type of natural or scientific

33:44

law well then if You observe that socially constructing gender and race is

33:51

I is ideological to maintain or further power now we're getting at a critical

33:56

understanding give you an example of what this might look like gender according to many scholars

34:03

is socially constructed from even before a baby is born in this world when for

34:10

example expectant parents paint a nursery either blue for a boy or pink

34:16

for a girl take a look at this Google search

34:23

result and here you can see that I simply typed in boys toys and these are

34:30

the return this is what Google returned racing car um construction vehicles a

34:38

helicopter and here even a kind of weapon a slingshot truck down here these are

34:47

parts of life activities Pursuits that are associated by dominant culture with

34:54

masculinity and toughness now look at what comes up when I search girls

35:01

toys a unicorn a camera a cuddly toy

35:07

cotton candy fluff makeup

35:13

kit now another interesting aspect of looking at this example is to note that it is possible excuse me that the

35:22

algorithm is giving me these particular results based in part on character

35:27

istics for example where I live the understandings that the algorithm has

35:33

about my own gender or maybe even my occupation according to my previous

35:40

searches and that we can also look at from a critical perspective more of the political economy perspective that

35:46

foregrounds the role of capitalism in society nevertheless the important Point

35:51

here is to understand that for many scholars gender is socially constructed

35:57

through discourse through communication and through

36:02

culture so that was the third approach to understanding online identity and

36:07

that is that identity is socially constructed through communication discourse and social processes and

36:13

culture and there's a fourth way to understand online identity and that is a

36:19

postmodern view that identity can be understood as a project what does that

36:24

mean that identity can be understood as a project that people construct or

36:29

actively work on identities for themselves using culture using mass

36:35

media particularly and consumer goods so we work on construct our

36:44

identities so if I refer back to myself since I'm using myself as an example and many points in this uh

36:50

unit I would note that yes I do like many other academics and Scholars tend

36:56

to Value tradition mainstream quality journalistic Outlets like the New York Times And The

37:02

Washington Post over you know a smaller blog or news that may just appear in a in the form of

37:09

a meme on social media the adoption of those quality

37:16

journalistic sources or maybe I should say traditional journalistic sources for example if I were to site them in making

37:23

a post and Publishing a post online that would be one way that I was

37:29

constructing my identity through media or if you look at the clothes that different people tend to wear it's not

37:37

really probably an accident why I wear the kind of glasses that I wear you can just see it in the in the picture of me

37:43

on the top left because wearing those type of thick plastic

37:49

glasses is a way that people sometimes people who view themselves as um I'll

37:56

say charitably intellectuals uh construct an identity through wearing certain types of glasses

38:03

and yes sometimes professors do do things like wear v-neck sweaters and button the top button on a button-up

38:09

shirt and I've been known to wear both honestly that's true that is a way that

38:15

identity is sometimes constructed as a project and sometimes yes that identity

38:22

construction does follow certain Trends and cultural um phenomenon

38:28

and even stereotypes so this uh fourth approach

38:34

is to view identity as a way that people construct work on identities for

38:39

themselves for example by using or invoking certain mass media and certain

38:46

consumer goods like outfits glasses these two are examples of the

38:52

construction of identity that are TV shows made made about different ways

38:58

that identity is constructed and criticized queer ey right so the way

39:04

that um makeover shows uh stress that identity can be worked on and improved

39:11

would be consistent with this understanding of identity and the show botched is all

39:17

about how these two doctors fix plastic surgery that has been messed up you've probably seen that show well when people

39:23

have plastic surgery is it a way it's a it's a postmodern way to

39:28

construct your identity in this case by buying a procedure to improve oneself

39:34

interestingly enough if people let's say were really huge fans of queer ey or the

39:39

show botched and started to um post about those shows or follow those shows

39:45

or be part of fan communities or link to those shows online well then linking to

39:51

those shows showing others that you're a fan of those shows would be an additional way that identity is

39:57

constructed this time particularly online let's go into some more about how

40:05

identities are constructed online well first of all there is what we choose to show and there the point is pretty

40:12

obvious right um the pictures that we choose for our uh profiles the language

40:17

that we choose for our profiles what we choose to show is one way we construct

40:22

identity online another way is by interacting with others

40:28

who do we interact with online in what ways do we interact with them online

40:33

that's a way of constructing identity online another is through customization

40:39

for example in our social media account accounts customization means using

40:44

digital tokens like emojis and music and badges and avatars and memes and

40:54

hashtags these digital tokens that we choose to use use online can become for others symbolic

41:02

markers of our identity so what we choose to show which is kind of very closely

41:08

linked to customization how we interact with others the digital tokens again music

41:16

avatars badges uh hashtags memes digital tokens that become

41:23

symbolic markers of identity and fourth every digital piece of information every

41:30

digital Trace that we leave online that can be seen by others is contributing

41:37

toward constructing our identity online so think about that every single thing

41:42

every digital piece of information whether that is an image form graphic

41:48

form uh text form every digital piece of information that you provide that can be

41:54

viewed by others serves as part of your construction of identity

42:02

online how does online identity construction vary how does it change how

42:08

does it vary well first of all it can vary by a

42:15

concept that we have studied already technological affordances affordances remember what do people do and what do

42:23

people perceive that they can do with a certain technology or certain platform form so it can vary by technological

42:30

affordances this is one example of the YouTube page of the comedian Russell

42:35

Brand and So What YouTube affords is the ability to have to make a playlist and

42:42

have and and uh organize your videos according to theme or

42:48

topic so again YouTube affords the ability to make playlists which allows

42:54

people to organize videos according to topic so here Russell Brand has organized his videos according to topics

43:02

in society that he wants to talk about and sometimes these do involve

43:07

conspiracy theories he's actually been able to develop a large following kind of after his like movie he was in a

43:14

bunch of movies for a while several years ago after that he's been able to to get a large amount of followers

43:19

online uh because of cultivating his YouTube channel and making playlists because of what YouTube affords so so

43:27

technological affordances is one way that identity construction online varies another is what Gerson calls idioms of

43:36

practice that's kind of a strange term for an intuitive Point idioms of practice refers to a set

43:45

of norms around the use of technology that means that in our friend groups for

43:50

example we all have different understandings or Norms about how technology should be used

43:57

so let's imagine like you may have one friend group where it is accepted to

44:06

text very short messages but also use a lot of gifts and images and

44:13

memes but you may have another social group that has a

44:18

different idiom of practice about text messaging a different culture a different set of norms about the use of

44:26

the same techn in this case text messaging for example you may have a text group that revolves around your

44:31

family in which it is accepted standard to text long long text

44:40

messages so Gerson wrote about this concept that she called idioms of practice in this book The Breakup 2.0

44:47

this is a really interesting book where she set out interviewing a lot of

44:52

college students at her University about their romantic breakups and she found that in many cases in the vast majority

45:00

of cases the respondents in her interviews they didn't want to talk about why the breakup happened things

45:07

like compatibility and all that they really oftentimes wanted to talk about

45:13

how the breakup was communicated because for some people it

45:19

is totally acceptable especially for young people to break up by changing

45:25

status online they a certain idiom of practice for others even other young people that's totally rude and

45:30

unacceptable they expect a in-person visit Others May say okay the in-person

45:38

visit is over the top but they expect at least a phone call so there are different accepted

45:45

sets of Standards Norms cultures around the use of different text and that can

45:52

mean that identity construction varies online another way that online identity

45:57

construction varies online is that different social software or platforms

46:05

invoke different social contexts to give you an obvious example LinkedIn the

46:10

social context there is professional so uh LinkedIn has a culture of job seeking

46:16

and searching and professionalism and a career orientation so uh the construction of on online identity in

46:23

LinkedIn is going to be professional because the nature of that platform now Tik Tok has certain characteristics

46:33

itself in terms of what is accepted on the platform many of you probably know

46:39

better than I do because even though I'm starting to study some Tik Tok and a particular issue area I don't use it

46:45

myself regularly so I don't I'm not that familiar with it but I'm sure that there

46:50

are certain social contexts that are unique to Tik Tok in other words you do

46:56

say your certain ways on Tik Tok that you wouldn't even if it was the same person on for example Instagram or

47:04

X another way that online identity construction varies is by the perception

47:09

of the audience right by the perception of the audience so you're going to construct your uh identity online differently if

47:18

you believe your audience is co-workers versus friends versus family members

47:23

especially older family members for example

47:31

now let's begin talking about identity and difference and we'll focus the whole

47:36

next unit on identity and difference but I want to begin that discussion in this unit when we talk about difference we're

47:44

talking about different aspects of identity what we're doing what we do in

47:50

society online is to use categories what are some examples of

47:56

these categories that will Mark differences in identity well ethnicity

48:02

race gender sexuality class ability

48:07

status so studying online identity is all about using categorizing excuse me

48:14

categories to identify

48:19

difference Scholars have tended to think about difference online in two main ways

48:25

as intersection ality and as

48:30

assemblage intersectionality is the view that online identity and

48:37

difference can be understood as multiple but stable overlapping facets of

48:44

identity and how they affect experiences of power and privilege again we're

48:51

remember using this critical perspective multiple but stable over

48:56

cling facets of identity and how they affect experiences of power and privilege so for example I will observe

49:05

that online and offline uh there are two prominent aspects of identity for myself

49:11

more than two but let's talk about two one is that I am a person of color that

49:18

I am half asian Indian and the other is that I am male I

49:24

self Iden identify as a mail those two

49:31

overlap and so are going to be Key Parts to understanding my

49:38

experience of power and privilege online and offline in this particular example

49:46

my gender identification male and my

49:51

ethnic or racial identification mixed race part Asian Indian I'm also part

49:56

British is going to those two are going to

50:02

intersect and have a large influence on my experience of power and privilege in society but there's another way to

50:09

understand difference online and that is to think about difference not as different stable

50:18

facets overlapping but rather as difference as a group of interwoven pieces identity as an

50:25

unstable incoherent set of feelings emotions and information that may be

50:32

different for each person so that's a different way of

50:37

understanding called assemblage well let's say for example you might take someone else that has shares those

50:43

characteristics that I mentioned that for me intersect for example an ident a

50:49

self-identification of a male and a self-identification as a mixed race person Part White in this case part

50:57

British and part Asian Indian but that person may have a totally different

51:02

sense of identity that is based on feelings emotions and different information than

51:08

mine so again here we're talking about identity and difference and two approaches to viewing difference and

51:15

identity online one that is intersectionality and one that is

51:21

assemblage and let's conclude this unit with thinking about how people have

51:26

problems with maintaining online identity problems with maintaining

51:32

online identity which leads to a concept called context collapse the collapse of

51:38

context context collapse which is when social Technologies like our social

51:44

media make it difficult to vary our self-presentations based on environment

51:50

or audience because we don't just have most of us don't just have one social media

51:56

platform for example only dedicated to co-workers or family

52:02

members we like it or not we accept a friend request from a different group

52:07

context collapses makes it very different to neatly vary our

52:14

self-presentations online and so for

52:19

example I do have older family members and co-workers

52:24

who I'd rather not see the the side of myself that goes to music festivals and concerts and uh has a you know it

52:32

evidences a different side of myself it's I can't keep the

52:37

self-presentation totally neat and separate according to my audience or

52:46

environment people many of us most of us maybe even all of us we actually

52:52

strategize to overcome context collapse and one interesting way to understand

52:58

how people strategize to overcome context collapse is by understanding how people have different Instagram accounts

53:04

and I'm guessing that several of you do maybe many of you so people young adults

53:10

often have mostly young adults often have what is called a Fina and a

53:15

rinsta the rinsta is the Instagram under the person's real name in which they

53:23

often want to look poised some sometimes professional fashionable happy sometimes

53:31

glamorous and then people have a Fina which is a fake Instagram account with a

53:36

different name where people kind of let their guard down show themselves without

53:42

makeup or acting silly or on a bad day or what they look like when they first wake up in the

53:48

morning I just read about another one where some people now are having three or more uh one person I was reading

53:55

about said that they have have a bsta which is a Instagram account reserved

54:01

only for that person's best friends so people strategize to overcome

54:09

context collapse the interesting thing to me about finston rinsta is which one is the most authentic

54:15

probably the fina which is the fake Instagram account with a different name usually but is the one where often it

54:23

represents the most authentic um communication of someone's identity

54:31

and yet that one is called the fina the Rin the rinsta so-called real one is the one that tends to be more

54:39

polished if you want to pause this recording now and think about an instance of context collapse you have

54:46

experienced please do again that is where you have not been able to keep

54:51

neatly separately your self-representations your identity

54:56

separated according to on according to uh audience or context maybe a family

55:03

member has seen a post you made when you really only wanted your BFFs to see it that would be an interest an an example

55:09

of context collapse all right let's end this unit with some takeaways and further thought

55:15

well first of all according to our author Alice marwick the internet as

55:21

disembodied playground or Workshop is a fantasy

55:26

okay that did not turn out that is a fantasy she notes that and she is one of

55:32

the leading Scholars of digital culture that any split between online and

55:37

offline identity is

55:43

narrowing according to marick the social construction of identity through discourse through

55:50

communication through culture through social interactions the social construction of identity has become more

55:56

self-conscious and visible we now know we're doing it more we do it more and it

56:02

is more visible to use an example that many of you are familiar with when people now are using so

56:08

often filters changing their appearance or their features they are

56:14

self-consciously socially constructing their identity and it's visible so often

56:19

to many people online Mar also notes that the internet

56:25

and social media make identity expression explicit not implicit but explicit

56:32

constructed performed mobilized that's one difference in on an

56:38

offline media offline identity expression can often be implicit just

56:44

understood internet and social media make identity expression explicit choices that are made in image and Emoji

56:51

for example online we experience a back and

56:57

forth between Singularity and multiplicity Singularity means a single

57:02

more fixed type of identity multiplicity is more flexible where we have multiple

57:08

different identities there's a back and forth between those

57:13

online and finally according to marwick the internet has not liberated people

57:19

from the structural oppression of difference things like institutional

57:25

structural racism or the underfunding of some communities and some parts of

57:32

cities versus other ones so the internet has not liberated

57:38

people from the structural oppression of difference for example being a person of

57:45

color uh the internet has sadly not limitated people from oppression based

57:51

on assumptions or stereotyping that people often have for certain people of

57:57

color in certain circumstances that's just one example and with that that will end this

58:04

unit thank you very much for listening and for watching
