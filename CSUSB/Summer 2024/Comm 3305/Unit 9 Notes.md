If there was a war between humans and AI, which side would be more ethical? Idea behind the movie.....

## Artifical Intelligence (AI)
"The capacity of machines to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition, enabling them to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence"

How can we theorize AI from the persepective of communication?

A.I. as Extraordinary

## AI as Extraordinary

What are the implications for our **humanity**?

At stake: **Who we are** as humans, and what it **means to be human**

Places our collective **humanity up for grabs** in ways that can **elevate** or **destroy** the human race, depending on how AI is implemented

AI seeks to **re-create** part of us that we have conceived as being **uniquely human** - our **minds**

Shows us the AI scene, then the last one

Deep Blue wins!

"**Talk of AI**": media representations and how scientists discuss it

"**Mind as Machine**", "**Machine as Mind**:":
Metaphors in which the nature of the **human mind**, and the nature of the **machine** are being **compared** to make a conceptual connection between the two

![[Pasted image 20240701225046.png]]

AI tech. and their function usually **described in human terms**

![[Pasted image 20240701225123.png]]

**AI** is something of a **myth**!?

## AI as Extraordinary: Problems

This theoretical lens is from the **mid 1900s**!

Metaphors connecting body and machine are clumsy

**Anthropomorphic** portrayals don't account for **differences in AI compared to human traits**

![[Pasted image 20240701225332.png]]

Focuses too much on the AI technologies of a **fictional tomorrow**

What about the AI that we use in mundane aspects of **everyday life**?

## AI as Ordinary

**AI** is conceptualized as a type of **communicator**
**Interactions with devices and programs a form of communication.**
The machine becomes a **communication partner**

![[Pasted image 20240701225549.png]]

## AI as Ordinary: 4 Steps
1. **Where does the tech fit wihtin AI as a whole?** (e.g.  founders, purpose, function, level of intel involved)\
2.  What are the aspects of peoples **direct interactions with the AI tech.** that inform their **understanding** of it? (e.g. interaction, interface)
3. Messages re: the specific tech and AI generally (e.g. culture, media, marketing)?
4. What are **users' own interpretations** of the AI tech?

# Takeaways and Further Thought
- AI has sometimes been thought of as a savior or destroyer of humanity!
- AI has been theorized as extraordinary, for the implications for our humanity, and in the context of the future
- But this conceptualization is....stale (lol)
- Are AI "ordinary"? Or does this miss their transformative potential?
