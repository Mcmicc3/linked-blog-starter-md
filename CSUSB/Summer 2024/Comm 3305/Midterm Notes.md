# UNIT 1


1. How did we define digital media? Do digital media have to be Internet-based?
    

Digital Media shapes culture and society. Its true definition is “Content that is transmitted as digital data, which at its simplest involves digital cables or satellites sending binary signals, signals such as 0s and 1s to devices that translate them into audio, video, graphics, text, and more. Digital media does not have to be internet-based, ex: Digital alarm clock.  

  

2. Explain the components of the communication process. 
    

Sources: Idea->Encoding->Channels: Message->Receivers: Decoding->Meaning

Sources: Someone sending the message 

Channels: Voice, Internet, Laptop, Zoom

Receivers: Gets decoded by source. Is the person receiving the source info, For example, they may take source ideas as biased, racist, etc. Sources and Receivers go back and forth and normally give feedback to one another

  

3. What is social context? Relational context? Cultural context? Physical context? Psychological context?
    

Social context: Everything that relates to social dynamics in communication, such as setting, ex of setting: communicating in the president's office compared to communicating with the president in a subway

Relational context: Type of relationship and depth of relationship between the people who are communicating, ex: How we act on the first day of class with the professor compared to the end of the semester because we got to know him a lot better

Cultural context: When there are groups of people who share similar interests, values, etc. ex: if you are mixed you may interact differently. Such as if you are White/Asian you may be more formal with your Asian side of the family, especially towards your elders.

Physical context: Physical surroundings, ex: In the classroom, outside, alone in a room 

Psychological context: What is in people's minds when they decide to communicate/interact with others, ex: Pandemic causing people to not like crowds and still be worried about COVID effects. You were not scared of crowds before pandemic and now you are even after things calmed down

Noise: Interferes with communication

  

4. With regard to technologies, including communication technologies, what are technical features? What are affordances and constraints?
    

Technical features: describe appearance, components, and/or capabilities, think about the item itself as well, ex: an apple watch that is a digital clock but is made to look like an anolog style to give that sense of nostalgia back to the customer, the old fashion leather, the signature in the middle of the brand that looks fancy and comes from a well known company, see how all of that effects the individuals perception of the item

Afforances: Fundamental properties that determine how the technology is use, ex: door knob, it affords people to go through the door, affords people to be locked out of the door, scissors have two holes that are meant for your fingers to go through so you can afford to cut things, ex: skyscrapers, glass is flat allows people to afford to see out window, afford a surface to be tagged on  

Constraints: Fundamnetal properties that limit how the tech can be used, ex: Scissors have a constraint by being a poor weapon, airmaze apple watch with leather strap can effect mountain climbing,

  

5. In the discipline of communication, how do we conceptualize (technological) affordances?
    

In communication, tech affordances are the manner in which a tool or medium affords used to individuals. Meaning an affordance in communication is describing the uses that people think of there technology, for media and the tasks they can accomplish, and how people think they can use media, communication, and devices

  

6. What were the affordances of an iPOD? Constraints  on of an iPOD? How do the constraints of the iPOD help explain why the iPOD went extinct?
    

Affordance of iPOD: Affording ability to carry around your musical library, afford ability to crate digital files, store them in this device, and use a wheel like UI menu to pick your songs, storing all of your songs

Constraints of iPOD: You could not use it as a cellphone

The iPOD became obsolete because of the IPhone and how the Iphone could not only store music but was also a mini super computer that has a lot more capabilities besides just playing music. Things such as personalization, ability to call, text, and watch videos

  

7. What are some of the affordances and constraints of a virtual reality headset? How do the affordances of Instagram differ from those of Facebook?
    

Affordances of VR headset: is immersing you into a virtual world, affords your limbs to be free so you can use limbs to interact with world

Contraints of VR headset: Have a big device on head, limits where you can use it

Affordance of Instagram vs Facebook: affords highlights pictures/hashtags/storytelling of social media compared to Facebook where texts are more prominent, TIKTOK affords to use, create, and consume compared to every other platform

  
  

8. Explain the assertion that with regard to communication technologies, technological affordances vary by personal, perceptual, material and contextual factors? 
    

Personal: Personal experience/view of that individual technology that may differ from someone elses views, especially on the importance of it ex: you major in politics so your perception of politics differs on someone who is not into politics

Perceptual: You may perceive that technology different compared to someone else, ex: You may perceive that Facebook is not popular at all however someone who grew up with Facebook and still uses it will perceive it differently. 

Material: Technology material, such as Iphone titanium, making people believe it is a lot tougher and can be brought to more “rough” places 

Contextual factors: Think of the context of the technology, Iphone using the hashtag while demonstrating how good quality there phone is 

  

9. How did the Taylor Swift Tumblr example demonstrate that technological affordances vary by perceptual factors? 
    

Swift fans and Taylor Swift herself perceive that tumbler afforded a safe type of space/communication where other platforms had bullies and trolls.

  

10. How did the #ShotOniPhone example demonstrate that technological affordances vary by contextual factors?
    

You can take amazing portraits, using a cat in a jacket to display just how detailed the Iphone is in terms of good camera quality, the ongoing argument that Iphone has better quality and using a popular hashtag, In short, afford to take great picture and possibly even movies 

  

11. What are the affordances and constraints of Tinder vs. eHarmony and what is the significance to society of the differences (e.g. with regard to dating/relationships)?
    

Affordance of Tinder: Afford ability to concentrate on images to have them being prominent, to swipe left and right on people you like or dislike, how close your match is, more sex, more meet ups, short relationship goals

Contraints of Tinder: Constraints the ability to write long bios/backgrounds, to express yourself via text

Affordance of eHarmony: Very detailed bios, deep understanding of individual via text, long relationship goals

Contraints of eHarmony: Makes quick image based judgments on people 

  

12. Explain the assertion that affordances are a form of power.
    

  
  

# UNIT 2

  

13. Explain the concept of causality, and how we related comm. technologies vs. human decisions to causality.
    

Causality is what causes difference and/or change in society.

Causality has three aspects: (1) technological determinism- machines determining how society changes with little human interaction, (2) social construction of technology- opposite in which humans shape how society changes, and (3) social shaping- an in between view of both 1 and 2.

Comm tech. (e.g., technological determinism) and human decisions are two extreme opposite views. Both views look at how tech changes society through both tech and humans (using tech).

  

14. How did we apply these terms to analyze the dating app Tinder?
    

By utilizing the idea of causality on Tinder, we can see that tech determinism is where the app leads to changes in human perspectives on dating. Social construction of tech looks at early culture differences like playboy magazing, etc. led to current perspectives on dating.

15. Explain the position of technological determinism. Why is it a disempowering perspective?
    

Technological determinism: the view that technologies cause change in society with little human resistance. Technological determinism is usually viewed when technologies are relatively new. Hence, this is a disempowering perspective because people fear that technology has more power than people themselves.

  

16. Explain the binary within tech. determinism: dystopian vs. utopian narratives. 
    

Technological determinism is typically binary with either a dystopian (i.e., tech making things a lot worse) and utopian narrative (i.e., tech making things better).

Dystopian narrative: Stories involving teh and tech being responsible for the world being a lot worse (things falling apart). Humans are losing control while technology is more powerful. Humans are becoming dependent on technology. People are unable to stop the change (they can’t stop the advancement of technology).

Utopian narrative: new technologies are bringing excitement to the world in several ways. Technology is thought to bring greater democracy, equality, shared power, prosperity, and lessening of human conflict.

  

17. What are three common dystopian narratives?
    

1. We are losing control (i.e., technology is making us dumb; we are losing control of women).
    
2. We are becoming dependent on technology.
    
3. We are unable to stop change.
    

  

18. What examples did we use to demonstrate each? Explain the assertion that every major new technology brings excitement about a utopian society.
    

1. We are losing control (i.e., technology is making us dumb; we are losing control of women).
    
2. We are becoming dependent on technology. → Ex. smartphone addiction
    
3. We are unable to stop change. → Ex. Terminator SkyNet
    

Every major new technology brings excitement to a utopian society because it is though that tech makes things better. It will bring greater democracy, equality, shared power, prosperity, and lessening of human conflict.

  

19. Explain the position of social construction of technology. Why is this an empowering perspective?
    

Social construction of technology: The view that people are the sources of change in technology and society. This is an empowering perspective because it gives us the thought that we are in control of change and not technology itself.

  

20. How might technology developers be responsible for change in society (due to their technologies)?
    

Following the social construction of technology idea, technology developers might be responsible for change in society by changing social contexts. Ex. → Humans develop oversexualized females in social media, video games, movies, etc.

  

21. What examples did we use to demonstrate this? 
    

Examples we used to demonstrate this idea come from video games, such as Grand Theft Auto and the MechanicaX movie.

  

22. What is Nakamura’s concept of “identity tourism”?
    

Identity tourism: People of a dominant race develop ideas of minorities with no respect and just for fun. Ex. Cole Train, Gears of War (2006) shows him as a black male who is tough and savage. Chun-Li, Street Fighter (1991) is oversexualized as an Asian woman. Both video games were designed by young white males.

  

23. How might tech users be responsible for change in society?  Explain the emoji example we used to demonstrate this.
    

Technology users might be responsible for change in society by demanding change. As we see in the emoji example, emojis were not as representative of the people as they are now. Concerning skin color emojis, the only options were a light pale color or yellow default color. Because the public demanded change, tech companies then expanded the range of skin colors in the emoji section.

  

24. Explain the position of social shaping. 
    

Social shaping: The view that technologies and people BOTH influence each other. Hence, this position is an “in-between,” “two-way” view. People, technologies, and organizations ALL have the power to influence the use of technology in society.

  

25. Why is it an “in-between,” “two-way” view?
    

It is an “in-between,” “two-way” view because both technology and humans are influencing each other. It is not one or the other.

  

26. What does it mean to assert that communication about technology (including movies and TV) is reflective? 
    

Communication about technology is reflective of what humans think about AI and the possibilities of AI. For example, “Is it possible to fall for AI? Is it possible AI can deceive us? What will we do with AI? Has AI blended in society and we’re not aware of it?” Hence, we show our concerns and ideas this way through pondering as a society.

  

27. What concerns/hopes/fears does The Matrix reflect?
    

It was reflecting our concerns about cyberspace/the internet.

  

28. What concerns/hopes/fears does Ex Machina reflect?
    

It reflected our fears about AI, such as their power and whether or not they have taken over already.

  

29.  With regard to Ex Machina, if causality (what is caused) refers to the infiltration of AI into human society, how did the two Ex Machina scenes we watched align either with technological determinism or with the social construction of technology?
    

- The scene where AI- Ava creator is showing how he structured/created the brain falls more in line with the social construction of technology.

-The scene where AI- Ava murders AI- creator falls under technological determinism because humans lost control of the technology (dystopian narrative).

3. Participatory culture
    

  

31. What is the significance of Manuel Castells’ concept of the “network society”?
    

  

32. From the perspective of the “network society” (our contemporary society), who and what have power through communication? Why is this point significant, and how is this a big change from the mass media era?
    

  

33. What is convergence culture? What elements or entities are converging?

39. Explain the values of diversity and democracy specifically as they relate to participatory culture.
    

  

40. Explain the meaning and importance of the following points of caution regarding participatory culture, discussed in the lecture: 
    

• Digital media are NOT inherently participatory

• Participatory cultures may or may NOT be oppositional or resistant to the dominant culture/ideology

• Participatory culture did NOT originate with digital media (what pre-Internet examples of participatory culture were discussed?)

• New media companies are now capitalizing directly on people’s participation

• Participatory culture can have NEGATIVE or HARMFUL effects (what two examples were discussed?)

• Online, people find ways of maintaining status/distinction

  

41. What is the potential connection between the perspective of participatory culture and technological determinism (specifically, utopian narratives)?
    

  

42. Is the perspective of participatory culture empowering or disempowering with regard to users, and why?
    

  

43. Explain the assertion that “participation” is something to aspire to.
    

  

# Unit 4 

  

44. What is participatory politics?​​
    

- The way that the mechanisms of cultural participation get harnessed for political purposes. 

45. How does the concept of participatory politics relate directly to participatory culture?
    

-   
    

46. What is civic imagination and how was this awakened in Henry Jenkins through “Star Trek”?
    

- It featured a very diverse group of people, african american, asian, a different species. 
    

They saw a better society, they imagined a better future,they saw a better future.

47. Be familiar with the “basics” or fundamentals of participatory politics. 
    

- Civic imagination: “relationships between acts of the imagination and origins of political consciousness”
    
- Participants often have an artistic side: they make and share media 
    
- Political exchange through informal learning communities, including those around fandom or gaming. 
    

48. How did we demonstrate each? 
    

- Civic Imagination example was “ Star Trek” all of the diversity. 
    
- Artistic side: Example, band groups, DIY Magazines, in our time Art can be a very important aspect.  
    
- Fandom/gaming: fan pages like Harry Potter, Twilight, platform of different fan fiction 
    

Gaming: informal community participatory politics :World of Warcraft 

49. What are the forms of participatory politics and how did we demonstrate each? 
    

- Sharing of information through social media

- Using microblogs like X ( Twitter) to rally a community towards collective action 
    
- Building databases to investigate an ongoing concern 
    
-   
    

50. What did the YouTube video from the World of Warcraft guild-master (shown in the lecture) demonstrate?
    

- Talking about lessons that he has learned, it's a social space for people to socialize, micromanaging was not good for him to do as the guild master, do not always check up on people to allow them to be themselves. 
    
- These same lessons can be applied to a political justices movement, social justice movement, protest organization, 
    

  

51. How did the dreamactivisit.org (DREAMer) examples, discussed in class, demonstrate participatory politics/culture?
    

- This is an organization made by activists to engage in participatory politics to bring attention to this cause, and advocate for the passage of the dream act.
    

52. With regard to participatory politics, why should we beware of both utopian and dystopian discourses? 
    

- - they are not going to solve every problem in society but they are not going to ruin society either. 
    

# Unit 5 

  

53. What is cancel culture, as we understand it in society now?
    

  

54. Explain the Dave Chappelle incident and criticism in which some thought activists were trying to “cancel” him. Was he really cancelled?
    

  

55. Is the idea of “cancelling” someone new? What famous novel was used to demonstrate this point?
    

  

56. Explain the two opposing perspectives we used to think about cancel culture. What examples did we use to demonstrate each perspective? 
    

  

57. With regard to the perspective that views cancel culture as a form of empowerment, explain the assertion that analyses of “cancel culture” must start with the power relations by which it is defined.

62. Why are cancellation – and its criticism – about power? Explain the following statement: Digital media are likely to reflect and reinforce cancelation practices rather than drive them.
    

  

# Unit 6

  
  

63. Explain the assertion that identity is constructed of language, social structures, gender orientation, and cultural patterns
    

1. The discourse, or written/ spoken language
    
2. Influence of families, friend networks, and romantic relationships all influence our own identity
    
3. Gender orientation 
    
4. Shared understandings, norms, and values of a particular group. Can be based on ethnicity, race, or gender for example. 
    

  

64. What does it mean to assert that identity is often approached by scholars from a critical perspective?
    

1. Focus on Power: ability to influence other people/groups. Force, military might, money, or attraction like online influencers are examples.
    
2. Inequality: usually white, straight males have enjoyed more power over others
    
3. Social change: How we can do something about the state of inequality 
    

  

65. What is personal identity; and by contrast, what is social identity? 
    

1. Personal: Distinguish us from others
    
2. Social: Define us as a group; both voluntary and involuntary 
    

  

66. How can social identity be voluntary or involuntary? What example did your professor give to demonstrate involuntary social identity?
    

1. An example is we choose, or volunteered, to go to college so we are all students of csusb. The example the professor gave of an involuntary social identity is that he is part Asian and people may assume that like other Asians, he is going to be a doctor or anything to do with STEM science even though he could just want to be an artist. 
    

  

67.  What is disembodied identity?
    

1. Ourselves are separated form our physical bodies. Eg, online profiles for social media or video games
    

68. Which kind of identity best applies to digital media?
    

  

69. With regard to type of identity, what are subjectivity, representation and self-Presentation?
    

1. Subjective: How we think of ourselves
    
2. Representation: How different facets are depicted in culture and media
    
3. Self Presentation: How other present themselves in digital spaces
    

  

70.  Which kind do we focus on, with regard to internet-based communication?
    

1. Self Presentation
    

  

71. What did the L-word and Will & Grace examples demonstrate about media representation?
    

1. They demonstrated the lives of gay and lesbian couples but did not accurately portray them. In the L-word, the women were always sleeping with others and in Will and Grace, they should relationships as more of a heterosexual way
    

  

72. Why and how did some early scholars of the internet and of digital culture think that the internet may serve as an “identity workshop”? Why did that not come to pass?
    

1. They thought people could experiment with different identities and personalities, making it obvious that these categories were social constructions. The hope was it would lead to less discrimination 
    
2. It didn’t work because people didn’t create radically different selves online, discrimination is not solely based on appearance and commercial software didn’t allow people to experiment
    

  

73. Explain fully the four approaches to online identity construction. Explain the assertion that many scholars make: gender is socially constructed. What examples were discussed that back this assertion?
    

1. Identity as Fixed or Static: Unchanaging (example: Work profile)
    
2. Identity as Flexible and Changeable: be able to alter to suit online contacts. May change based on context (where they are) and audience (who they are with), (example: social media profile, much different then a work profile)
    
3. Identity as constructed through Discourse and Social Processes
    
4. Identity as a Project: people construct or actively work on identities by using mass media or consumer goods 
    

  

74.  Explain this statement: “Multiplicity is an INHERENT property of identity RATHER than dishonest or fake.” 
    

1. People think that when people have different aspects of their identity, they do change their identity online
    

  

75. What examples were discussed that demonstrate a postmodern understanding of identity as a “project”?
    

1. Prof. Mazumar used the example of himself being a professor and liking academics, he likes to learn through quality journalistic outlets like the New York Times over a smaller outlet like a blog. Another example is the clothes that people wear are ways people view themselves. The shows Queer Eye and Botched are also examples.
    

  

76. Be able to explain how identities are constructed online (there are 4 ways).
    

1. What we choose to show: Our profile picture or the language we use
    
2. How we interact with others: Who and in what ways
    
3. Customization: Emojis, avatars, hashtags, or memes are some symbolic markers of identity
    
4. Every digital piece of info a person provides: images, texts, or videos shared
    

  

77.  What are “digital tokens” and how are they symbolic markers of identity?
    

1. See question 76 part c
    

  

78. Be able to explain the 4 ways that online identity construction varies.
    

1. Technological Affordances: What do people do and perceive what they can do with technology, an example is running a YouTube channel
    
2. Idioms of Practice: A set of norms around a set of technology. We all have different understandings of how tech can be used like texting in a group with gifs, or abbreviations like “lol” but in another text group, longer messages, and proper language are used
    
3. Different types of software/ platforms invoke different social context: LinkedIn has characteristics that show professionalism while TikTok people act more casual
    
4. Perception by the audience: Coworkers vs Friends vs Family Members are examples of different groups
    

  

79.  Be able to explain the Russel Brand example used to demonstrate one of the 4 ways. 
    

1. Russel Brand used his popularity as an actor to create a YouTube channel that talks about different topics in society and has developed a larger following online thanks to YouTube
    

  

80. Be able to describe what “idioms of practice” are.
    

1. See question 78 part b
    

  

81. With regard to identity and difference, what are some categories that can be used to note Difference?
    

1. Categories are used like ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability status
    

  

82. What are intersectionality and assemblage? How do they differ?
    

1. Intersectionality: Multiple (stable) overlapping facets of identity and how they affect experiences of power and privilege (Example: being male and mixed race intersect)
    
2. Assemblage: Grouping of interwoven pieces; identity as an unstable, incoherent set of feelings, emotions and information that may be different for each person
    

  

83. What is “context collapse”? 
    

1. People who have problems maintaining online identity. Social tech like social media, makes it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience. Keeping some audience, like older family members or co-workers, from knowing you go to raves or music festivals may become harder as time goes on
    

  

84. How do Finstas and Rinstas demonstrate how people strategize to overcome context collapse?
    

1. “Rinsta” is ones Instagram where they use there real name and want to show how well they are dressed or their job while “Finsta” is another account that doesn't use not their real name and is more casual, showing people their funny side for example. “Finsta” may be the most authentic of the two.
    

  

85. Explain Marwick’s observation that the internet has “NOT liberated people from the structural oppression of difference”.
    

1. The internet as “disembodies playground is a fantasy”
    
2. Any split between “online” and “offline” identity is narrowing
    
3. The social construction of identity has become more self-conscious and visible
    
4. The internet and social media make identity expression explicit (constructed, performed, mobilized)
    
5. Online we experience a back and forth between singularity (one identity) and multiplicity (mutiple identities)
    
6. The internet has NOT liberated people from structural oppression of difference (example: funding in one part of the city versus another based on class or race)
