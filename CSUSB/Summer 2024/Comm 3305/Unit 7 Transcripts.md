0:04

hey everybody uh welcome to unit 7 online race gender and sexuality let's

0:11

begin with a couple of announcements well first of all discussion response for uh your last discussion response of

0:17

course is due on Thursday at 11:59 p.m. and progress quiz three uh is you have

0:25

to take that on Friday uh you must take it on Friday and you can take it as early as a.m. and you must submit by

0:33

11:59 p.m. that works just the same as the other progress quizzes okay so let's just take a couple

0:40

of minutes to review from the previous unit in the previous unit we started talking about

0:46

identity how we can understand identity and how we can think about how people

0:51

construct their identity so we discussed four different ways one is to think of identity as

1:00

something that is fixed or static or doesn't change for example I am a

1:05

professor or tenure track uh Professor a faculty member at

1:12

CSUSB another way is to think about identity not as something that doesn't change but as something that is flexible

1:18

and changeable because for you or to you if you're my audience I'm a professor

1:24

but I'm also a husband I'm also a member of my family I'm also just one of the

1:29

the crew of my friends so another way to think about identity is not that it is fixed but that it is flexible and

1:36

changeable a third way is to think about identity as being something that is

1:42

socially constructed that it is not something that exists just in and of itself that

1:48

it is constructed through discourse communication with other people and

1:53

other entities and through social processes so for example we're going to

2:00

talk a lot in this unit and we began talking about it in the last unit how many scholars think that gender and even

2:07

race are socially constructed through communication through media through

2:13

social processes like our friend groups and schooling socialization

2:19

processes then a fourth way is to think about identity

2:25

as a project this is a postmodern understanding

2:30

of identity as a project that people can add to throughout their lives build

2:36

through for example mentioning or invoking certain media like movies that are our favorites

2:43

TV shows that we love and identify with right sports teams or through material

2:49

Goods certain aspects of our outfits for example glasses hats purses Etc that

2:57

become a way that we build our identity so these are four approaches to Identity

3:02

construction generally whether offline or online and then we talked about briefly

3:10

fairly briefly in the in the last unit about identity and difference when we think about difference in identity what

3:18

we're doing usually is to apply categories to certain

3:23

people those categories are usually ones that involve race or ethnicity gender

3:31

sexuality class and increasingly being studied ability or disability

3:38

status so usually when we point to or we try to think about and understand

3:45

identity and difference what we are doing is placing people within categories and sometimes those

3:51

categories intersect to create um new or

3:56

layered or deeper understanding ings of identity so just take for you know so I

4:02

am a um uh I am a I consider myself a a male uh and I am someone of mix race

4:10

those through two things intersect and today we're going to talk

4:16

more about identity indifference specifically how to conceptualize online race gender and

4:22

sexuality as those three are not the only ones and not the only important ones but three of the most common ways

4:28

of thinking about difference and how we can analyze these types of difference

4:34

online I want to make a point of caution here because a lot of what we're going

4:39

to be talking about in this unit comes from a critical perspective of

4:45

scholarship we talked about this briefly in a previous unit that critical scholarship often looks at power power

4:54

imbalances or power asymmetries and how social change can happen so that power

5:00

is more equally dispersed when you look at Power that requires you to think about groups who

5:08

have power and groups who don't in other words dominant groups and those who are

5:13

marginalized or subordinated in somehow dominant groups tend to be

5:20

whites males and heterosexuals now the point of caution that I want to make is

5:25

that when we talk about these dominant groups it's not meant to be an attack on any one individual or even any group of

5:34

individuals it's a critique of the way these

5:39

identities are socially constructed the social construction of whiteness the

5:46

social constructions of maleness or male normativity the social construction of

5:54

heterosexuality so just to be clear it's not meant to be an attack on any one individual or any particular particular

6:00

group it's a critique of the social constructions of these kinds of identities one further aspect of the

6:05

note of caution uh this is um one school of thought from prominent scholars in

6:12

this area uh as with anything that you learn in my class you can uh accept it

6:19

and agree with it or not accept it and disagree with it whatever uh is up to

6:24

you I only ask that you do your best to understand these perspectives

6:29

okay so here's what we'll do first we'll talk about race as a concept and we'll think about background and key Concepts

6:35

and how to analyze online race then we'll think about gender in

6:41

terms of background and key Concepts and sexuality because those two are often analyzed in

6:47

Tandem and we'll conclude with how we can analyze online gender and sexuality which again are often uh researched and

6:55

thought about not always but often considered in tandem okay let's begin first with the concept

7:02

of race and discuss briefly the understanding that some and even many

7:08

scholars have that race is socially

7:15

constructed race meaning the most common ways of of

7:21

understanding would be for example whites or Hispanics

7:27

non-whites blacks or African-Americans for example are common ways that we categorize people according to

7:36

race but Scholars have argued that understandings and really this desire to

7:44

neatly categorize people into racial categories which is tricky for someone like me of mixed race right I always

7:51

need to check mark at least two things on governmental forms right but in my whole life I can remember early on there

7:58

wasn't a uh an opportunity even to check multiple

8:04

boxes but many scholars will point out that our contemporary or modern

8:12

understanding of race only really dates back in America to the

8:18

1700s some Scholars argue that the common understanding that we have of

8:24

race in this country was started so that white Americans could

8:33

justify the slave trade slavery so obviously keeping people in

8:42

bondage exposing them to horrific conditions abusing them not letting them

8:47

be free considering them property is awful but could be justified in the

8:55

1700s if you establish that these were people meaning slaves of another racial

9:03

category and therefore shouldn't be expected to be treated the same as people from the white racial

9:10

category and so some Scholars argue that our modern or current understanding of

9:17

of race in this country when I say current I mean longstanding I don't mean right now in this year but our dominant

9:25

understanding of race in this country really began in the 1700s as a way to justify this horrific institution of the

9:32

slave trade here's some more evidence for that some ethnicities that may now

9:39

be considered white were not always considered white depending on social

9:45

context and thus you can see how some people think race is socially constructed for example as this article

9:52

points out Germans Greeks Irish Italians and Spaniards have

9:57

all sometimes as a matter of Law and sometimes as a matter of public opinion

10:03

sometimes been excluded from the white category at some point here you can see a a racist sign

10:11

from New York City in the early 1900s when there was a wave of Irish people immigrating to New York City and to the

10:18

United States no Irish need apply so if you take into account some

10:26

of this history that some ethnicities that are now considered white were at some point in American history not

10:32

considered in the white category then how come how can it be just a matter of

10:38

biology that there are certain easily distinguishable

10:43

races this kind of thought leads Scholars to understand that race can be considered socially

10:50

constructed all right now since we're talking about race and difference let's consider two

10:56

concepts to racialize and the concept of

11:01

interpolation to racialize is a process in which we race others in our minds's

11:08

eye giving them a label that corresponds or contrasts with the one we give

11:15

ourselves so let's say for example I'm looking out the window at somebody in my apartment complex and I give them a

11:24

label let's say that uh I see the Asian neighbor of

11:32

mine uh depending on in my case depending on what type of Asian I'm talking about it could be one that

11:37

corresponds with my identity because I'm half asian Indian or not could be an East Asian

11:42

person so to racialize people is something that we do on our mind giving

11:48

people a label that either corresponds or contrasts with the one we give

11:54

ourselves now let's talk about the concept of interpolation

11:59

interpolation Scholars argue is that we derive our sense of identity from how we

12:05

respond to the ways in which others implicitly categorize us through public

12:11

speech and gestures each day essentially that we are aware of some of the ways in

12:18

which people implicitly categorize us even if it's non-verbally how they react

12:23

to us in life we aware of how others see us and we derive our sense of identity

12:30

in part or even in large part by how we respond to the ways in which we notice others categorizing

12:37

us there are three types of interpolation and I can demonstrate them

12:42

by giving examples from my own life the first kind is called non- interpolation non- interpolation is when

12:50

members of certain racial groups feel ignored or feel

12:57

non-existent and so for example this could happen if let's say there was a party

13:03

where everyone there was white and I went to the party and felt that nobody

13:09

really wanted to talk to me um just standing by myself or you

13:14

know very few people would talk to me um non interpolation is to feel ignored or

13:21

non-existent on the basis of your race negative interpolation is to feel

13:27

uncomfortably noticed and made visible in an uncomfortable way in a negative

13:32

way so one example of this this actually happened to me I was living in uh in

13:37

London for a while many years ago in my 20s and uh there was a a terrorist attack there the 77 attacks where

13:46

terrorists uh blew up um a couple of buses in London and I believe the London

13:51

subway the underground uh and I can remember in the days after that like taking a train or

13:58

even walking down the street and people giving me side eye why because I'm

14:03

racially ambiguous I could be even though I'm I'm factually not not that there's anything wrong with that at all

14:09

but I could be someone of Middle Eastern or Arab descent and so I can remember kind of people kind of giving me side

14:16

eye when I would be in public that is negative interpolation feeling uncomfortably noticed and made visible

14:23

and then there's Mis interpolation which is understanding of

14:28

the self to be included in a definition of everybody and later addressed in a

14:34

way that makes it clear that they are not so misinterpretation is when somebody of a certain racial identity

14:41

thinks that they're included in a conversation or in a reference or as

14:46

part of a group and later understands that they are not so an example of this may be let's say that

14:54

um uh let's say I'm in high school this one didn't happen to me exactly but but some varieties of these kinds of things

15:00

happen to me let's say that I'm in high school and it's graduation party uh and I over hear somebody saying everybody in

15:07

the senior class is going to be invited to this party and let's say that I am not invited to this party and I think

15:14

it's because I don't have the same racial identity so in in the first instance I would think okay yeah I'm

15:20

going to be invited I'm graduating I'm a senior in this class but later I'm not one of the people invited that would be

15:25

an example of Mis interpolation and then there is the concept of white

15:33

invisibility and and and this is one of those examples of of understanding or approaching this conversation from a

15:40

critical perspective some Scholars argue that whites are reminded of their race far

15:47

less frequently than others whites have the privilege to render themselves

15:56

raceless here's some more information on this concept of white invisibility whites can

16:02

assume that just one second I just want to make sure that the recording is okay yes um whites can assume that they are

16:09

race neutral and only those who are members of minority groups have a race and this is a kind of privilege this is

16:16

an aspect of white privilege because invisibility has advantages for whites

16:22

for example thinking of oneself as invisible racially

16:29

or a kind of race neutral or just a sort of default neutral race enables white people to deny the

16:37

advantage that their whiteness brings to them in society so let me uh give you an example

16:45

of of how we can understand this um in an episode involving Justin

16:51

Timberlake and Jesse Williams so several years ago Jesse Williams was given an award uh at the uh bet Awards let's

17:00

watch in response which led to some people to

17:05

take exception to him reacting this way him being a white male uh that some

17:13

people would believe has the privilege of taking his

17:20

white invisibility for granted and so you see this uh person kind of taking him to task

17:30

and then at first Justin sake kind of claps

17:36

back and then realizes uh oh this is kind of getting out of hand in terms of

17:41

people's opinions and responses to me and then

17:47

ultimately really

17:54

apologizes so obviously you're free to have your own opinion on the backlash

18:00

first of all on Jesse Williams sentiments and then the Justin Timber's

18:05

response and the backlash to tber Lake but the point here is not to advocate for either one or any view of the people

18:12

involved but to demonstrate how for some people uh Justin ter latees white

18:19

invisibility gives him a kind of a privilege which was called

18:24

out make sure you read through uh the assigned article the brief history of online and race as a hint that you could

18:31

well see uh a quiz or an exam question on that part of the reading what about

18:38

analyzing online race in particular well first of all we can note

18:44

that racism online operates in sometimes very obvious ways and sometimes more

18:49

subtle ways so for example when this um vlogger PewDiePie who's one of the

18:56

earlier uh earliest kind of vloggers but one of the most popular who has millions and millions of

19:02

followers uh first denies he's racist and then uses the nword in a live stream

19:08

that's a pretty obvious way that racism can operate online you have less obvious ways at

19:16

first when you look at for example the cover of certain very popular video games that are often of course discussed

19:22

a lot online and you see the kind of

19:27

stereotypes that are involved in this cover The Stereotype of for example the Hispanic male in the uh tank top with

19:34

the tattoos who looks like a criminal right or here you see the black male with a handkerchief over the face

19:41

which looks like there's criminal criminality

19:47

involved other examples we can look back at the characters col train and Chun Le

19:53

which we talked about when we discussed the social construction of Technology uh for some people these are

20:00

obvious examples of racism online for some people these are more subtle for example some people might say well yes

20:06

it's uh it's actually um cool and even complimentary to have the black

20:13

character the black Avatar cold trained be tough an ex aete Gruff

20:19

muscular right and yet um Lisa Nakamura gave us the concept of identity

20:26

tourism which is that since most video game designers are going to be white

20:31

males uh they design characters like this which allow a lot of video game players especially players who are white

20:38

males to try on different identities and then leave them behind in a kind of

20:44

superficial way which is also something that Jesse Williams noted in his acceptance

20:52

speech another way we can analyze online race in particular is to find examples

20:58

of and note when we understand or when we see

21:03

evidence that the internet has a default assumption the default Assumption of the

21:10

internet is that it is non rced in other words that it is white and that many onlookers argue is

21:19

because of who is most active in designing and building our new

21:26

technologies notably in NorCal in Silicon Valley and the Ugly Truth according to

21:32

this Guardian article is that there's a real lack of diversity racially and on

21:38

the basis of gender and perhaps other markers in uh in Silicon Valley and they design

21:47

uh internet and and and platforms and new technologies and then Mir mirror image of themselves which is a sort of

21:56

default whiteness this is kind of an interesting screenshot that uh demonstrates a

22:03

reaction uh to how some people don't want to be associated with the idea that

22:09

the default of the internet is white so this person Andrew McGill

22:16

argues that oftentimes the lighter skin uh symbols emojis are not used as much

22:23

as the darker skinned ones even by people who are fair skinned or white

22:28

and the reality here is that people don't want to be some people some white people don't want to be associated with

22:35

this idea that the default Assumption of the internet is that it is non-ra or white another way we can analyze analyze

22:42

online race is to note the presence of cybertypes cybertypes just mean

22:47

stereotypes that are online and circulated online here's one that was part of the

22:55

marketing campaign that Aloo Loco did um recently fairly recently um the Abella

23:02

approved marketing campaign which was fairly successful uh but this campaign and some

23:09

I'm sure different people have different feelings about it but it nevertheless invoked a stereotype of anaba uh which

23:17

is kind of very very key to the family very charismatic very involved and even

23:24

the person that has the most influence in the family so you know again people are going to

23:30

have different opinions about this campaign but it does use the stereotype of a grandmother for Latino Latin Latina

23:38

latinx people the take a look at a more recent example

23:44

from GTA Grand Theft Auto and this is a trailer for a recent edition of the game and see if you can note how many

23:51

cybertypes in other words stereotypes that are circulated online how many stereotypes are reflected in this uh

23:58

GTA additions and right from the beginning you see that there is a young

24:04

woman who looks to be like in some kind of counselors or even a pro PE meeting um somebody's in trouble and

24:12

that is a young latina right so that's a stereotype that people of certain backgrounds tend to be get in trouble in

24:19

in places like schools or or or or even in institutions like Correctional institutions you have of course

24:26

stereotypes involving um African-Americans um that are um you

24:33

know gangsters or you know um you know people who are Hustlers right um an

24:40

interesting stereotype that was not necessarily emphasized in here but exists nonetheless is one that is

24:45

actually based on class and that is The Stereotype of poor white folks and you can see uh if you caught that a couple

24:52

of shots of uh for example a white woman holding a bat and a guy uh what looks to

24:58

be something similar to a trailer park something like that which is a

25:04

stereotype in this case a racial stereotype uh well it involves race but it's actually based on class or money

25:12

which is The Stereotype of a poor white person so here you can see examples of

25:18

cybertypes in other words digitally circulated

25:23

stereotypes however we can also and we need to also observe that in terms of

25:29

analyzing online race race can be a powerful way of organizing both to oppress people but

25:36

also to resist oppression and to find commun Community or Sol solidarity

25:41

excuse me solidarity with others and here again we can arrive at the concept of black Twitter there's a different

25:47

definition than the one that we T looked at before a public group of specific Twitter users who choose not to pass as

25:55

a different racial group but rather priori ize the performance of their racial

26:01

identity uh and do that in solidarity with other people who don't choose to passes another race but prioritize

26:08

performing their racial Identity or another example of finding

26:14

Community online uh in a way that invokes race was

26:19

the uh hashtag Oscars not so excuse me Oscars so white the hashtag Oscars so

26:25

white um a few years ago that was a way of of resisting oppression in the sense

26:33

that um it was trying to point out how the Oscars often times uh prioritizes in

26:39

its finalists and awards uh White recipients another way we can analyze

26:46

online online race is to note that participatory politics can be used to invite expressions of emotional

26:54

solidarity with those who are suffering so recall our concept of participatory

27:01

politics which is when participatory culture in some way invokes or references politics or Civics

27:09

participatory politics can be you used to invite emotional solidarity with

27:15

others who are suffering and let me give you an example from a few years ago and uh that was uh that there was a video

27:24

that a comedian named uh Billy put out uh a video on YouTube called [ __ ]

27:31

black girls say and this went viral and it was offensive to many people because it featured this comedian wearing a wig

27:38

and saying and doing things that stereotyped black women but this cultural critic Franchesca

27:46

Ramsey took this as an opportunity to point out the racial

27:51

microaggressions that many black girls have to endure when around white girls

27:58

in other words to invite solidarity among those who are suffering let's

28:04

watch um Franchesca Ramsey's uh remix of this

28:11

meme uh that was originated by that

28:16

comedian all right and so this video was all about not to be racist racial

28:22

microaggressions what are microaggressions the automatic and often unconsciously uttered insult

28:28

and dismissals routinely directed toward people of color so this was a video uh

28:36

that pointed out the racial microaggressions that black girls often have to endure at the hands of their

28:42

white friends so digital platforms can be used

28:47

to find emotional solidarity with others who are suffering and finally in an in terms of

28:54

analyzing online race we can point to the use of humor humor can be very

29:01

powerful actually in terms of understanding digital culture especially in how digital content spreads another

29:07

word for that is goes viral things make us laugh because they help us feel Superior to others they display

29:14

unexpectedness or weirdness they correspond to a sense of place and

29:19

history and sometimes they provide relief in socially tense environments an

29:25

example of how uh humor was used uh online uh in terms of referencing

29:32

race came from an episode that happened several years ago so I'll spare you the details but the long and short of it is

29:39

that um a UCLA white student uh put out

29:44

a video I believe on YouTube many years ago that was basically racist that talked about um annoying or what annoyed

29:51

her at hearing listening to Asian students in the library and even making

29:57

fun of the way they talk using words like ching chong and so this person remixed it so there were many remix

30:04

remixes of some of the language in that offensive video um and uh and made it into

30:11

something humorous and those remixes actually spread widely online and became

30:16

every bit as uh attention worthy and more so than the original offensive video by the way that student from UCA

30:22

eventually had to um leave the school and transfer okay so that's our discussion

30:29

of race and how to analyze online race now let's talk about

30:35

gender sex as a concept is not synonymous with gender rather sex is

30:42

distinct from gender sex is the biological state that

30:48

corresponds to quote a man or quote a woman the biological State the presence

30:55

of or the domination not domination but the dominance of more hormones versus

31:01

other hormones but even sex According to some Scholars can be interpreted as socially

31:08

constructed you're free to agree or disagree with that but for example there's something called intersex people

31:13

where people who were born with significant amounts of both hormones so there are some Scholars who argue that

31:20

actually the drive to neatly categorize people into man and woman only came

31:26

about um decades ago when scientists became worried at what evidence was

31:33

showing to some degree at least that it's not such a neat categorization some people have born with both kinds of

31:39

hormones and um Wanted a way to be able to neatly categorize people nevertheless sex is distinct the

31:47

biological state is distinct from gender which is the social understanding of how

31:52

sex should be experienced and how sex manifests in Behavior personality

31:59

preferences and capabilities and so uh when we saw in the unit on cancel

32:05

culture Dave Chappelle's comments on gender uh according to the vast majority of Scholars he's mistaken in how we

32:12

understand understood gender gender is the social understanding of how sex is

32:19

or should be experienced what are some ways that gender is a social understanding if you

32:26

want to pause the recording and think about that please feel free to I'll just relate one I lived many years in New

32:33

York City and when you'd ride a crowded Subway what you see so often is that men

32:39

would have their legs splayed all over the seats legs open splay out taking up

32:45

space women were expected to sit quietly take up less space with their

32:51

legs together you know taking up little space and and and sitting you know with

32:57

the legs tightly together uh not able to sort of spread out and relax or at least

33:03

not able in terms of social understanding so that's one way that gender is a social understanding and

33:08

there are many I've referenced one in a previous unit when parents PID Paints

33:14

the bedroom for an expectant baby either pink or blue that is beginning the social construction of gender even

33:20

before that baby is born gender is a system of

33:26

classification and in our society an ideology or ideology is part

33:32

of it that values male gendered things more than female related things which

33:38

leads us to the concept of male normativity male normativity according to Scholars the universalized male body

33:45

and experience is often constructed as average or normal while female gendered

33:51

experiences are conceptualized as variations from the norm one example of

33:56

this would be that until recently for example airplanes or in particular like

34:03

fighter jets the cockpit was designed for the proportions of the man or male

34:10

body male normativity it's the default another example here would be

34:16

the way that is accepted that some people especially in some careers some types of social strata to behave so this

34:25

is Leo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street where greed sex infidelity drug

34:30

use was considered something that is just what the boys do that's an example

34:36

of male normativity as well normative normative just means based on Norms

34:42

Norms are agreed upon ways for social groups to act that are not laws

34:47

normative gender behavior is that which adheres to the dominant understanding of

34:52

masculine men and feminine women here's a very obvious example from American

34:58

culture the social uh Trope or stereotype of

35:05

the tough popular football player and the Beautiful feminine

35:14

cheerleader those understandings give R rise to normative gender

35:22

Behavior non-normative Behavior does not follow these socialist scripts and so one of the reasons why uh many people

35:29

celebrate the Williams sisters and Serena Williams perhaps in particular is because uh she does not seem to abide by

35:38

normative gender behaviors or expectations and here you can see that

35:43

that understanding or her refusal to follow normative gender behavior is

35:49

built here into this advertising campaign strong is beautiful there's some other examples of

35:55

non-normative gender Behavior lizo uh whose um Embrace of body

36:03

positivity and bodies of different shapes although I understand she's been criticized and um accused of being um

36:11

predatory uh to her uh dancers for example uh but her Embrace of her body

36:21

type is an example of non-normative gender Behavior Uh her refusal to try you know

36:27

quick fat diets to to lose weight another example would be Lil nzx who's openly

36:33

gay as a male black um musician and rapper uh and um

36:41

his um openness including in his music music videos about his sexuality is an

36:47

example of nonnormative gender Behavior make sure also please to read

36:54

through the section of the chapter uh that deals with a brief history of

37:01

online uh gender last let's discuss sexuality

37:08

sexuality what is sexuality sexuality is an individual expression and

37:15

understanding of desire which leads us to the concept of

37:21

heteronormativity heteronormativity is the presumption of heterosexuality rather than other kinds

37:27

of of sexuality unless explicitly stated otherwise it's a little bit like male

37:33

normativity but instead of focusing on gender here we focus on sexuality in this case the presumption of

37:39

heterosexuality unless explicitly stated otherwise what does that mean it means

37:45

that heteronormativity which is part of dominant ideology in our and other

37:50

societies values some experiences as normal and natural what is the flip side

37:56

of that Stig izing others as pathological or deviant and so for

38:03

example heterosexual monogamy is viewed by the dominant ideology in our society

38:10

as normal and natural whereas other kinds of sexual Lifestyles like polyamory are viewed by dominant

38:17

ideology or BDSM for example as

38:24

deviant sexuality like gender is often viewed as a binary but actually it is

38:32

not according to many observers and

38:39

Scholars and so the concept of queer can be used as an umbrella term for

38:47

non-normative expressions of sexuality dominant discourses around

38:54

sexuality and also gender often View sex or gender as fixed

39:00

unchanging intimately intertwined and based on

39:08

biology but as we have come to understand more and prioritize more

39:15

lgbtq plus and also IA communities we have come to increasingly be

39:23

skeptical of viewing sexuality and gender as something that is fixed or unchanged

39:30

and based on biology this is just one example uh of

39:35

this of this refusal to accept that that uh rigidity or that

39:43

um uh sorry I just want to make sure I Ed the the word that was here that

39:48

um fixedness according to this

39:55

article the categories of heterosexual sexuality and homosexuality themselves

40:00

are social constructions because 100 years ago

40:06

reporting this article people did not self identity identify or identify

40:12

others as heterosexual people engaged in different types of sex without needing to place

40:20

themselves in the category category of heterosexual so some argue that the

40:25

concepts heterosexuality and homosexuality themselves are social constructions how can we analyze online

40:33

gender and sexuality well sometimes well excuse me one way is to observe that

40:39

Technologies themselves like social media the actual Technologies themselves

40:44

can be loaded with assumptions about gender and sexuality why because of the social construction of Technology built

40:50

into the Technologies themselves are assumptions about gender and sexuality for example

40:57

at least recently I haven't checked very recently but at least pretty recently when you wanted to explore the social

41:04

media platform pinest these were some of the categories of interests holidays

41:09

animals architecture art Beauty design DIY and crafts lawn and garden food and

41:15

drink many of these are Pursuits activities that would be that

41:22

would be identified more with the female gender than the male gender so you can make the argument that

41:30

Pinterest at least has been itself loaded with assumptions about

41:36

gender another way to analyze online gender is to ask this question are the expressions of gender and sexuality

41:43

online that are in question are these Expressions influenced by what the technology itself the people using it by

41:51

Society at large or some combination of these for example if we look at the Char

41:57

character or Avatar um Juliet Starling which is in the video

42:03

game lollipop chain saw so when you see these um

42:09

hypersexualized tropes of this character uh and its

42:17

implications do the do these types of Expressions

42:23

um are they influenced by by what the Technologies themselves the lack of a different choice of an avatar in these

42:29

platforms built into the design of the platform for example by game players who demand this type of stereotyped

42:35

depiction by Society at large which hypers sexualizes young women right a

42:42

third way that we can analyze online gender and sexuality is to ask another question how

42:49

does the use of Technology reward or maybe discourage or punish non-normative or normative gender

42:57

or sexual identity in other words does the use of Technology does it reward or

43:03

it's opposite of reward punish certain kinds of gender or sexual identity ones that are either normative

43:09

that are consistent with Norms or non-normative that aren't consistent with Norms which leads us to the case

43:16

study in your reading the Julia Allison case study and this is an old case study

43:22

and the reading now is several years old but I want to make a point about some of these older foundational readings

43:27

yes they are several years old and yes technology does change rapidly however

43:33

some of the key Concepts many most of the key concepts for example in the marwick piece about identity remain

43:41

valuable the case studies the relevant case studies may change but the concepts

43:46

remain valuable to us and what happens in scholarships is that you know a lot of times these Scholars they don't go

43:52

back and rewrite the article because several years are passed we take it until until someone else writes another

43:58

updated seminal article on the on the concepts we take it that the concepts remain valuable for us with the

44:06

understanding that some of the examples of platforms the details the case studies will change so your article gives the case

44:13

study of this socialite Julia Allison which according to this Gawker blog which was a Blog at least part of this

44:20

blog Gawker that was dedicated to making fun of her according to this blog went

44:25

to the quote o fo School of PR so this is a Wired Magazine cover of

44:32

Julia Allison and so the argument in the case study was an interesting one and that she

44:37

was punished for not adhering to normative

44:43

expressions of gender online what do we mean by that well there's a certain expectation

44:50

according to dominant ideology and normative gender expectations that women online would often times s follow fall

44:58

into one of two camps one it'd be a certain type of cultural critic like a

45:03

scholar the other is that they would be very concerned with their image and

45:09

their outfits and the makeup um but also know when to kind of not rock the

45:17

boat but Julia Allison was somebody who in the earlier days of the internet used

45:24

these Technologies to become famous to become healthy

45:29

she kind of went a foul of or didn't adhere to expectations of gender

45:36

identity by promoting herself too much Overkill not knowing when to just kind

45:42

of sit back and not rock the boat and that therefore according to the case study because she didn't adhere

45:50

to traditional expectations of gender she was

45:55

punished harshly criticized flamed insulted

46:00

online we can make a somewhat similar observation about Olivia Jade so just briefly Olivia Jade was the um brief USC

46:08

student who uh was involved in the Scandal where some people from some prominent universities were found to

46:16

have took bribes basically for admitting um the kids of famous or wealthy people

46:24

like some college coaches for example would agree that agree to state that this person was on the ruing team even

46:29

though they weren't in exchange for money and so uh Olivia Jade she's the

46:34

daughter of famous people was punished online uh she was one of the people who

46:39

was admitted to USC uh by uh in in somewhat fraudulently because her resume

46:47

was falsified because the parents paid money to certain people at the school at USC she was harshly criticized online um

46:57

because she refused to just

47:02

um apologize and just you know uh say

47:07

that she had um she was shamed by this and kind of retreat into a corner right

47:12

and also she was she was shamed for saying things like oh you know I'm I'm only going to college to party and so

47:19

she didn't meet traditional expectations of gender of a college student female

47:24

and was punished for it and then there's this example I'm going

47:30

to I'm going to play a little bit of the interest of time um this is an example of a marketing Camp French uh phone

47:36

company um that or from a European phone company but a French marketing campaign that points out the hypocrisy uh with

47:44

regard to gender and um it shows in the first half of the ad I didn't want to

47:49

play the whole thing in the interest of time but in the first part of the ad you see all these spectacular goals uh from

47:56

male Superstar stars and male soccer players but actually this campaign used

48:01

artificial intelligence and deep fakes to substitute male bodies and faces to

48:09

these female uh players who were the actual players who scored these awesome

48:15

goals and and in so doing this campaign kind of points out the hypocrisy in how we

48:21

view um gender and stuff that goes viral or is considered awesome

48:27

especially

48:32

online a fourth way to analyze online gender is to note that participatory communities May resist dominant

48:39

paradigms of Economics or ownership or IP right so you may have a Blog that

48:47

refuses to sell itself to one of the big tech companies even still they often invoke

48:54

conventionally sexist tropes and here's one example from a meme that you would often find on Reddit now Reddit uh which

49:01

is owned by a subsidiary of K Nas the media company but didn't the owners the founders of Reddit didn't sell it to for

49:08

example Zuckerberg at Facebook or Google nevertheless so they may have

49:14

resisted the dominant Paradigm of big Tech I'm talking about the owners of Reddit however oftentimes the content on

49:22

these platforms all over the Internet including message boards often do invoke conventionally sexist tropes like this

49:29

one tits or get the F out all right let's um end this unit

49:34

with some takeaways and further thought many scholars of identity argue that race gender and sexuality are

49:43

actually socially constructed the internet has generally

49:48

not brought about more equality and progress unfortunately by encouraging or praising

49:55

or sanctioning certain kinds of behavior or displays here's an important Point

50:00

digital media cannot just reflect race gender and sexuality in and

50:08

inequality and stereotyping and difference but can actually produce race

50:14

gender and sexuality Technologies human decisions

50:19

and Society in general all help to produce online race gender and sexuality

50:26

so therefore we can take a social shaping view not technological determinism not social construction but

50:32

a social shaping in between view on how online race gender and sexuality are

50:38

produced but also keep in mind that online communities can be important spaces of resistance to dominant

50:45

ideologies and also can be important spaces for uh underresourced or

50:51

marginalized groups to find solidarity with one another and finally remember

50:57

that other types of difference what I mean by other is other than race and gender and sexuality are also important

51:04

for example ability or disability status and class and we spoke briefly about

51:10

class when we watched the GTA preview video and that will conclude this unit

51:16

thank you very much for listening and for watching
