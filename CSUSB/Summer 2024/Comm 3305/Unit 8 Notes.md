McChesney: Political economy should be the organizing principle for evaluating the digital revolution

## Why the political economy?

1. The ways capitalism **works** and **does not work** determine the role of the internet in society
![[Pasted image 20240627195212.png]]

2. Capitalism - or its euphemism, free markets - and democracy are **not the same** and have **very strong tensions**

Celebrants view that the internet reuslts in more cooperation/humanity.....is not purely hypothetical....but it is **NOT historical** or **credible**  ****

3. Celebrants often believe digital technology has "**Superpowers**" **over political economy**: '**openness**', **peering, sahring, acting globally**

![[Pasted image 20240627215120.png]]

- Little proof that this is happening in a captalist society.

![[Pasted image 20240627215147.png]]
4. The notion of the **free market** is **sacred** in our society

![[Pasted image 20240627215325.png]]
Problem: the genuis of the free market has little to do with really existing capitalism
Problem: the u.s. has a variety of material and cultural inducemnts to encourahge a hands-off policy toward capitalism

## Connectivity
Characterized by a change from a focus on users to a focus on their **data**; algorithms make online sociality profitable, serving a global market of social networking and UGC

Large and influential platforms have exploded in terms of users and **monetizing potential**

![[Pasted image 20240627215730.png]]
author pitches a shift from **Network communication** to *platformed* sociality

from a **participatory culture** to a *culture of connectivity*

## Surveillance Capitalism

- Through PE, we can make better sense of **why** digital media are how they are and **how to improve** them
- PE: Society and the P.E. of the internet rise and fall together
