hey everybody Welcome to unit8 the political economy of the internet and of

0:08

social media let's begin with a couple of announcements today first of all discussion response 4 uh is going to be

0:16

due on Thursday at 11:59 p.m. and progress quiz three will be on Friday

0:23

you must take it on Friday you can take it as early as 8 am but you must submit

0:30

by 11:59 p.m. of course once you start it uh you have to finish it in one

0:37

sitting and another announcement of sorts and that is to please kindly fill out your course evaluations um I hope

0:45

that you all know that a lot goes into putting courses together including this condensed summer course a lot of

0:51

decisions have to be made what is included what is excluded the approach that I want to take and the unique

0:57

nature of this course so please kindly fill out the course evaluation which you

1:02

will find the Saudi um that's our evaluation you'll find that link on your

1:08

canvas homepage um I can assure you that we do pay very close attention to your

1:14

feedback um we are here to deliver excellent course material and

1:20

presentation and we do take these very seriously and as you fill those out please do keep in mind the unique nature

1:26

of this course that it is condensed into only five short weeks that means that

1:31

only limited number of topics can be covered and the unique nature of the delivery of the course which is online

1:38

asynchronous so please keep that in mind all right so I'd like to take just

1:47

a couple of minutes uh to think about what it is

1:53

that we or you like about the internet or maybe even about social media in

1:59

particular particular so if we were in a classroom right now I would give everybody a

2:05

couple of minutes to think about this and then I would love to hear your responses so if you want to uh pause uh

2:12

this recording for a minute or two and think to yourself what is it about our current Internet or social media

2:19

dominated lives that you like what do you think is good about this time we're living in in terms of digital

2:28

media usually people answer and they say things like well the internet or social media allows people to be connected with

2:36

more people than ever before so let's say you're someone like me who has family in many different places even many different

2:43

countries well then social media allows you to stay in contact with more people

2:49

other people might say that social media allows people to express themselves whenever they want to and as we've been

2:57

covering in the last couple of units to build or show or communicate their identity in ways that didn't exist or at

3:04

least with frequency that didn't exist before other people might say something like social media allows people to find

3:11

communities of similar interests so whatever it is that you're into let's say for example you love board games

3:17

old-fashioned board games uh you can find a community for people who love board games on the internet so often

3:25

times people say things like that as to what they really enjoy what they think is good about our current social media

3:31

and internet uh dominated lives but let's also especially as

3:38

Scholars think about things that we don't like so much about our current

3:44

digital era what are some things that you don't like so much or that worry you

3:50

about our current digital era if you want to uh hit pause on this recording and think to yourselves please feel free

3:58

to here are a couple things that are often mentioned by students by observers

4:04

by Scholars that concern us about our current digital era well first of all

4:09

the fact that our current digital era can often lead to people feeling lonely

4:17

and isolated in fact it is said that gen

4:22

Z many of your generation has sometimes been considered the loneliest generation

4:29

that we've had why because people are often on their phones even when it comes to doing

4:36

things that would otherwise be offline social for example looking at dating or

4:43

chatting with people so the fact that we often are

4:50

tied to our phones even when we're out in public so we've all we're all familiar with a situation where you go

4:55

out to dinner with five people three or four on their phone constantly so we have that situation where um we

5:03

are or many people often feel lonely um and isolated because of our

5:09

current digital culture another concern that is often

5:14

noted is that we may feel that we lack privacy now we may feel that first of

5:22

all we have ads following us all around social media all around the internet we

5:27

may feel that whatever we post once for example when we're 16 years old we can

5:32

never get rid of that may stay with us forever and we may feel like it's a little creepy how much it seems that

5:40

excuse me for example social media seem to know about us in part because for example geolocation services are turned

5:47

on or the microphone excuse me I've got a little cough or the

5:53

microphone uh may be turned on to your phone so that it is constantly listening

5:59

here hearing things and then tailoring results to you've probably all had the experience where you start talking about something let's say oh I don't know a

6:06

product that you want or country that you may want to visit and all of a sudden you see an ad targeted to you a

6:12

lot of us find that creepy and maybe even an invasion of privacy or another concern that is often

6:20

noted and that will'll actually focus on more in an upcoming unit is the fact

6:26

that we live in an age where there are so many information distortions there is

6:31

misinformation there is disinformation stuff that is simply not true that spreads like wildfire

6:39

throughout the internet that's a major concern that we have well the perspective that we're

6:45

going to take today has an answer as to why some of those

6:52

concerns became exactly that concerns why those concerns

6:58

exist so the lens that we're going to take today and this is um we're going to

7:04

move away from uh what we had been focused on which is identity and

7:09

difference we're going to move to a different concern now and we're going to think about the perspective of political

7:18

economy the perspective of political economy is an understanding of our

7:25

economic system capitalism and its Rel relationship to

7:30

our political system in our case a democracy or more specifically more

7:36

precisely a representative democracy so in other words political

7:42

economists which is a common specialty for Scholars of communication to have in fact in our department of communication

7:48

studies we have several faculty members who are political economists it's a

7:54

excuse me a way of thinking about our society the health of our democracy by

7:59

emphasizing the role that capitalism plays in our democracy that is the

8:06

perspective of political economy the political economy is

8:12

consistent with this critical perspective that we've been invoking in the last couple of units that

8:18

perspective that looks at Power the ability to influence people

8:25

unequal amounts of power between different groups in society

8:30

and social change what we may be able to do about those unequal dynamics that

8:36

inequality so political economists tend to be critical Scholars the perspective

8:43

of political economy is consistent with a critical perspective if not critical

8:49

theory with a Capital C and capital T to the letter per

8:54

se so today in this unit from the critical perspective the influence Ence

8:59

of capitalism on the internet and on social media and why the influence of

9:05

capitalism on our digital lives matters to us why does it matter to

9:14

society here's our plan we're first gonna contrast through the lens or using

9:21

Robert mazni a famous scholar we're going to look at the difference in people who celebrate the div digital

9:27

Revolution versus people who skeptical of it then we're going to talk about

9:33

what can be thought of as the elephant in the digital room I'll explain more about that in a few minutes that is this

9:38

perspective the political economy then we'll narrow our Focus further to talk specifically about the political economy

9:45

of social media we'll end with a related perspective and that is one that the

9:51

scholar zuboff calls surveillance capitalism so in this first uh part of

9:59

the presentation I'm going to be drawing from a really well-known political

10:05

Economist a really well-known book called digital disconnect and if you look at the subtitle there it really

10:10

tells the whole story as to what this perspective of political economy is about how capitalism is turning the

10:17

internet against democracy and this book uh was written

10:23

several years ago but its insights are still relevant and in this book The The

10:29

Scholar mzn starts out discussing just how incredible the digital revolution

10:35

has been in terms of how quickly digital media have spread or profused through

10:42

Society in a relatively short amount of time and mchz you

10:48

know quotes or cites some statistics which by now are out of date but we can look at recent

10:54

statistics that'll help tell the story of just how incredibly

10:59

in fact even sort of in a revolutionary way the spread of Internet Technologies

11:04

has been how quick that's been how fast that's been so here is a timeline uh

11:10

from a a report that's put out on a regular basis by a group called we are

11:16

social that looks like the number of individuals looks at the number of individuals who have used the internet

11:22

who are using the internet overtime in millions so you can see all the way back to the first website in 1991

11:29

when 6.8 million people were using the internet uh by

11:36

200 six that number was let's see just look at every 10 years that was 90 91 by

11:43

2001 498 Million by

11:49

2011 2135 billion all the way up to recent times now

11:57

5.34 billion

12:03

people so that is an unbelievable amount an exponential

12:09

increase in Internet usership over really just a few short years and

12:15

decades a similar observation can be made about social media some of our most

12:20

well-known social media were invented and became publicly available in the early

12:27

2000s 2004 friender 2003 Myspace 2003 Facebook

12:33

2004 so this is number of social media user identities over time you can see

12:39

the exponential increase in Social Media usership resulting in now or recently

12:46

five more than five billion user identities in the world that are using

12:52

social media that's an unbelievable amount of growth in terms of diffusion

12:58

in a very few short

13:03

years so another way to refer to these dynamics that we seen in just a very few

13:09

short years and decades we can call that the digital Revolution and mchz notes

13:14

that usually people observers commentators Scholars fall into two camps here we can

13:21

see again this push towards a binary right this limiting binary two and only

13:27

two which we tend to to see people fall into when thinking about analyzing

13:33

technology so mchz notes that commentators onlookers Scholars tend to

13:39

fall into two camps when analyzing the digital Revolution celebrants those who

13:47

celebrate the digital Revolution and Skeptics those who are skeptical of the

13:52

digital Revolution this is an example of a celebrant somebody who celebrated the

13:59

internet Revolution is something that has been wonderful The Scholar the public

14:05

intellectual playay shery who wrote for example this best-selling book here comes everybody the power of organizing

14:13

without organizations here's the subtitle Revolution doesn't happen when Society adopts new technology it happens

14:20

when Society adopts new Behavior so the argument here is that the internet has made people adopt new behaviors where

14:28

people can organ organized to achieve outcomes often in a way that benefits Society without having to be part of a

14:35

formal traditional organization as used to be the case in the past and so

14:42

mzn comments about such celebrants of the internet or the digital Revolution

14:48

mcz says celebrants reaffirm that the internet will be a force for democracy

14:53

and good worldwide ending monopolies of information and centralized control over

15:07

communication by contrast here are two examples of Internet Skeptics these are

15:14

people who rather than celebrate the digital Revolution are skeptical of it

15:19

think that it may lead to bad things the author and commentator of

15:26

Technology Eli Pariser who wrote this best-selling book called the filter bubble how the new personalized web is

15:33

changing what we read and how we think so this was a a really important book a

15:39

few years ago that showed how uh people generally tend to live in filter

15:46

bubbles where the only information and this we've discussed this briefly in a previous unit the only information

15:52

really that they're being exposed to through search results and algorithms

15:58

online is consistent with what we have already uh input and what the data or

16:08

inputed views of our network connections are in other words let's take an example

16:15

if you're left in terms of politics or if you're on the right wing you tend to see stuff online that already is

16:21

consistent with what you already think because the algorithms of the social media Technologies are designed to show

16:27

you stuff that you already agree with largely that makes you angry about the

16:32

other side and is going to show you stuff from your friend network

16:38

connections who are going to be people most often who think like you anyway that effect in society is called the

16:44

filter bubble and the idea here from Eli Pariser is that's not a good thing

16:49

because it means that we aren't exposed to other viewpoints other opinions about

16:55

for example political issues so Eli parisy Paris is an example of a

17:00

skeptic another example of a skeptic is Sher turl who wrote this book called Alone Together which is really all about

17:08

the internet Paradox the internet Paradox is this idea that despite the fact that the internet and social

17:15

technologies have the ability to make us communicate with more people from more places than ever

17:22

before we actually are more alone because we are just trapped on our phone

17:29

rather than communicating with more people that's called the internet Paradox we're shunning social events

17:36

again the dinner example you go out to dinner with six people most of the people are on their phones all the

17:43

time so there's a rather clever title that tur that turl uses called alone

17:49

together so Sher turkle is another example of an Internet skeptic and so

17:54

about Skeptics mzn the political Economist observes Skeptics fear that

18:00

the internet is recreating people in Technology's image flattening our

18:05

intelligence and lessening our creativity that we are losing what was

18:11

once thought of as our Humanity now I'm hoping that some bells

18:19

are going off in your minds and I'm hoping that those bells

18:26

are going off because such rhetoric is sounding familiar to

18:32

you because people who celebrate the digital Revolution and people who are

18:38

skeptical of it those views taken to their logical conclusions or

18:44

extremes yes those are consistent with utopian narratives with regard to celebrants and in the case of Skeptics

18:52

dystopian narratives those narratives that we

18:57

studied before that could be consistent with technological determinism but mzn the political

19:04

Economist said both of those views people who celebrate the digital

19:10

Revolution people who are skeptical of it mzn says both of those

19:16

positions actually miss the most import important point in terms of a discussion

19:21

of the digital Revolution the most important point from mz's

19:27

perspective is what he calls really existing

19:35

capitalism so capitalism not as it is held out to be in movies or novels or

19:43

according to Folklore or ideology but capitalism

19:49

is it as it actually exists is the elephant in the room in terms of

19:55

analyzing the digital Revolution the elephant in the room is a phrase that is used to

20:01

mean something that is an obvious point that people are don't want to acknowledge that people feel awkward

20:07

about talking about that's what the phrase elephant in the room means and so in this discussion of the

20:12

digital Revolution the elephant in the room the thing that is obvious and important that nobody wants to talk

20:18

about is the role of capitalism so mzn the political Economist notes that both KS camps the

20:26

celebrants and the Skeptics are ignorant about really existing capitalism and

20:32

don't appreciate how capitalism dominates social life in our

20:43

time all right let's delve more into the elephant in the digital room which is

20:50

capitalism so mzn argues that political economy this understanding of our

20:55

society our democracy in a way that emphasizes capitalism political economy should be

21:03

the organizing principle for evaluating the digital Revolution not just

21:08

something that is talked about only occasionally when people talk about the big tech companies up in NorCal but

21:14

rather the role of capitalism should be the very principle around which the

21:19

discussion of the digital Revolution is

21:25

focused so why why according to mzn the political Economist should the political

21:32

economy of the internet be the organizing principle of our discussions of the digital

21:38

Revolution well first of all mzn notes that the ways that capitalism works and

21:45

does not work determine the role of the internet in

21:50

society so let's look back at our two examples of Internet

21:57

Skeptics in the case of the filter bubble Eli pariser's book why is it that

22:04

we are in these filter bubbles where much of the information that we're seeing is consistent with what we

22:11

already agree with because of what we've previously put in in terms of our data traces and is consistent with the views

22:18

of others in our social networks who are people that we usually agree with anyway why is that and the answer is because

22:25

that is why the algorithms or that is how the algorithms are designed to maximize our time on those

22:34

platforms so that those companies those tech companies can better and more

22:41

profitably sell advertising because what happens is I'll

22:47

just summarize this very briefly the big tech companies have huge

22:53

amounts of data and build models based on

22:59

people's likes and dislikes their preferences online and

23:05

they say to advertisers well I can allow you to microt Target many many people

23:12

who believe this or believe this this set of preferences how do you build those data

23:19

models the way you build those data models more effectively with hundreds or thousands

23:25

of data points for each user you build those data models by getting people to

23:31

stay online longer on your platform longer and click more you do that

23:37

by prompting people showing people information that

23:43

they're going to engage with what they already believe or that makes them angry at people that are not like

23:51

them so in short the main reason why we have this filter bubble effect why

23:57

Technologies Ste steer us into these filter Bubbles and Echo chambers of opinion is

24:03

because that is how they make more money through selling

24:08

advertising a similar observation could be made about the turl uh arguments and

24:14

book Alone Together social platforms social media

24:19

digital tools are designed deliberately to make us stay on them

24:25

more to depend on them and some cases some observers have said that to make us

24:30

even addicted to them because they have an interest in us

24:37

staying on the platforms more so that they can make more money through selling

24:42

advertising so it's capitalism that is the root of some of these negative

24:49

implications of our digital tools a second

24:55

reason that mzn argues that the political economy should be the organizing principle in terms of our

25:03

discussions of the digital Revolution is that capitalism or it's euphemism free

25:09

markets euphemism is a way of saying the same thing but in a less severe less

25:14

harsh way capitalism or free markets and democracy are actually not the same

25:22

thing even though some people mistakenly think of them the same they're not they actually have very strong tensions

25:28

there's a very strong tension between capitalism and democracy MZ notes that people who

25:36

celebrate the digital Revolution celebrants view that the internet results in more cooperation in the world

25:43

more humanity is not purely hypothetical means that there are isolated instances

25:49

of this the internet resulting in helping to cause cooperation in humanity

25:55

but generally speaking is not historically uh is not historical based

26:01

on historical fact in terms of a pattern and is really not credible let me give you a couple

26:08

examples of this here's a recent Forbes worlds

26:14

billionaires list if you look at some of the richest the richest people in the

26:20

world you can see that you know just taking a a brief look

26:27

seven or eight out of the top 10 have made their money or making their money in technology in digital tools platforms

26:36

and the technologies that drive them and

26:42

yes what's our society like now has this explosion in startups in

26:49

money-making opportunities in Te in big Tech and big Tech conglomerates and

26:56

corporations and the rich people that control them have they led to more

27:01

cooperation more Humanity more democracy in society certainly not in our country

27:07

where we are arguably more divided than at any time since the Civil

27:14

War a third reason why the political economists mzn argues that the political

27:23

economy capitalism should be the organizing principle of our discussions of the

27:29

Revolution is that celebrants people who celebrate the digital Revolution often believe that digital

27:36

technologies have superpowers over political economy meaning that these superpowers

27:44

these aspirational admirable qualities openness peering sharing acting

27:54

globally that those values those phenomena

28:00

have powers over the realities of capitalism intersected with

28:09

technology one example of that may be for

28:16

example peer sharing or rather I should say open source opportunities like Linux

28:22

Linux is an operating system that is open which means that it's

28:28

nonproprietary that means that if you don't want to use the Mac operating system or Windows you could choose to

28:34

use Linux which is an open-source operating system that allows people to

28:41

contribute to refine the code and the way it works the operating system and

28:47

share it and use it free of charge so open source is a kind

28:54

of of of practice as well as value and value system that some people point to

29:01

and say see look at examples like Linux those kinds of opportunities those

29:06

idealistic opportunities those phenomena on the internet they can overshadow the

29:12

realities of capitalism so while you can point to odd examples like Linux the

29:17

reality is that in general when we look in a big picture way according to

29:23

mcchesney there is little proof that capitalism as a system is moving in this

29:29

direction of open source of acting globally of peering of

29:38

sharing in other words you can cherry-pick examples that

29:44

are idealistic that may benefit Society like the Linux open source operating system

29:52

but they are the exception rather than the rule and there's little proof that capitalism is moving in a direction for

29:59

example like open source a fourth reason why mzn says that

30:07

the political economy this emphasizing of capitalism when we analyze our society or democracy should be the

30:15

organizing principle in this discussion of the digital Revolution a fourth reason is that the

30:21

notion of the free market and its power is sacred in our society

30:28

free market is part of the metan narrative or the mythology of

30:35

American society for example as applied to

30:40

Technologies we have this type of revering or even mythology around Tech

30:48

startups you all probably know people who are involved or at least friends of people who are somehow involved or want

30:55

to be involved in the tech startup that's seen as a way to in an exciting

31:00

new way right make money and and and capitalize and take advantage of this free market system that we hold up so

31:08

high in our society so the notion of the free market as this great force where

31:14

everybody can have a shot right to make money if they play by the rules and do well that understanding of capitalism

31:22

linked with opportunity is sacred in our society

31:29

the problem according to mzn is that an understanding of the quote

31:35

Genius of the free market unquote has little to do with capitalism as it

31:41

really exists in society and one can note for example of

31:47

mergers and Acquisitions or we can look at what's happening right now to entertainment companies in the streaming

31:54

Wars as for example cable channels try to figure out what to do to make money

32:00

right um so the reality of capitalism has little to do according to mcz with

32:07

the mythology of the genius of the free market another problem according to mchz

32:13

is that we in the US we have a variety all kinds of different material and

32:19

cultural inducements to encourage a hands off policy toward capitalism

32:26

material would be different mechanism by which people can make money culture would be the ideology

32:34

behind those beliefs the ideology behind in America this view that we should take

32:42

a hands off attitude toward capitalism and here's just one example

32:49

of a screenshot from an article that tells people 10 of the fastest ways to make money on the

32:56

internet right we hold this up as a very uh in a very cultural culturally

33:03

respected way this idea that one can make money quickly and easily and

33:08

efficiently using technology and so mazni the political

33:14

economists argues that political economy once again this understanding that to

33:23

analyze our democracy our society we have to emphasize the role of capitalism

33:30

MZ argues that political economy holds the very key to understanding the

33:35

internet and how it's evolved over the

33:40

years let's now narrow our Focus down and talk about the political economy of

33:46

social media in particularly in particular excuse me because Scholars have focused on social media from a from

33:53

the lens of political economy specifically and now we can Define social media in

34:00

this way a group of internet based applications that build on the

34:06

ideological ideology is a worldview that build on the ideological and Technical

34:12

foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and

34:20

exchange of ugc user generated content this definition comes from the

34:26

critical political Economist van djk Web 2.0 was a was a an understanding

34:34

of a kind of techn technological flash point or Milestone

34:41

or turning point where we moved as a society from static web pages that

34:46

people read That's web 1.0 to a situation where we had the technology

34:52

and the ideology the worldview of people contributing uploading spreading their own content

35:03

and so the critical political economists yose Van Dyk then identified and defined

35:10

the concept of connectivity connectivity characterized by a

35:17

change from a focus on users to a focus on the data that users like us produce

35:28

algorithms of platforms make online sociality

35:34

profitable for example in the social media that we most commonly use Tik Tok

35:39

for example Instagram serving a global market of social networking and user

35:45

generated content notice before when we talked

35:50

about conceptualizing digital culture we focused on not the data that people

35:56

produce but users how users are and were empowered through

36:02

Network Technology in a way that was unprecedented that was a an optimistic

36:08

view of the digital Revolution that view held by Henry Jenkins and others this is a very different lens a

36:15

very different perspective from this critical perspective we can understand our time

36:23

not as a focus on users but as a focus on the data that we produce data that

36:31

are profitable in and through our social Technologies and the algorithms that are

36:38

designed for them so van djk notes that large and

36:45

influential platforms Facebook Instagram Tik Tok and so on YouTube have

36:52

exploded both in terms of users but also in terms of their monetizing potential

36:59

their potential to make

37:04

money and so now we can look again back at this social media timeline which

37:10

shows the incredible speed of the digital Revolution here specifically related to social media and the growth

37:19

in social media user identities overtime just look at this exponential

37:24

growth now over five billion billion user identities in the

37:30

world and so from this perspective of the political economy the focus is not so much on these users but on the data

37:37

that these users produce and how those data can be monetized and so van djk the critical

37:44

scholar the political Economist argues for a shift from

37:51

thinking about network communication as we did when we took a more optimistic

37:57

understanding of digital culture a shift from that to platformed sociality social

38:04

interaction between people that exists on platforms that are for profit businesses to make

38:10

money bendik also observes a shift from participatory culture which we've

38:17

studied in depth to a culture of connectivity let's look back at our

38:23

definition of connectivity again a focus on data instead of users and the algorithms that

38:29

make online sociality profitable so

38:36

this these examples and these definitions these Concepts The Scholar

38:41

of and djk is an example of approaching social media particularly from the

38:47

perspective of political

38:52

economy this Ted Talk by Tristan Harris who used to uh be one of the um really

38:59

important people at a big tech company in charge of how those platforms could

39:05

better influence people and persuade them gave this Ted Talk in order to warn

39:12

people about the dangers of technology and how effective they are at capturing

39:18

our attention you were assigned this video as homework but let's just watch the

39:24

very few first uh 30 seconds or show this introduction to the Ted

39:34

Talk I want you to imagine walking into a room control room with a bunch of people

39:41

hundred people hunched over at desks with little dials and that that control room will shape the thoughts and

39:50

feelings of a billion people this might sound like science

39:55

fiction but this actually exists right now

40:01

today I know because I used to be in one of those control rooms I was a design

40:06

ethicist at Google where I studied how do you ethically steer people's thoughts

40:12

because what we don't talk about is a handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their

40:18

choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today because when you pull out your

40:25

phone and they design how this works or what on the what's on the feed it's scheduling little blocks of time in our

40:32

minds if you see a notification it schedules you to have thoughts that maybe you didn't intend to have if you

40:38

swipe over that notification it schedules you into spending a little bit of time getting sucked into something

40:44

that maybe you didn't intend to get sucked into when we talk about

40:51

technology we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity could go any direction

40:57

and I want to get serious for a moment and tell you why it's going in a very specific Direction because it's not evolving

41:04

randomly there's a hidden goal driving the direction of all of the technology we make and that goal is the race for

41:12

our attention because all right I'll stop it there in the interest of time please

41:17

make sure you watch the entire Ted talk so this person

41:25

Tristan uh har and his Ted talk so he talks about how

41:31

there's a race among big tech companies to capture our attention and

41:40

control billions of Minds every

41:45

day but what we are really addressing in this unit is why why is there that race

41:53

for attention for our attention to get us to

41:58

uh really to to to steer us you may even say manipulate us into spending more and

42:04

more of our time on our platforms and and produce more data and click more why

42:10

this race to capture our attentions that Tristan Harris talks about he does address the reason why in this Ted talk

42:16

but only briefly and the reason why is because that is how these big tech companies can make more and more money

42:24

by selling advertising in other words emphasizing the role of capitalism in

42:29

our understanding of the digital Revolution there's a Netflix movie

42:35

called The Social dilemma which I'm sure some of you have seen which takes a similar approach in fact they interview

42:42

uh Tristan Harris in the uh in the movie uh which uses a similar approach which

42:48

talks about what big Tech is doing in terms of manipulating us and why so I

42:54

highly recommend uh this movie that you can on Netflix called the social

43:00

dilemma let's end this unit uh by briefly talking about another uh similar

43:07

perspective uh similar in terms of criticizing the digital Revolution and

43:13

its implications and why we are in the circumstances that we're in and that

43:20

perspective is called surveillance capitalism and so according to the scholar zuboff we're in the age of

43:26

surveillance capitalism now so shash zubu is a scholar who wrote this book

43:32

and is also actually interviewed in the Netflix movie The Social dilemma surveillance

43:38

capitalism is according to zuboff the unilateral claiming of private Human

43:44

Experience things that used to be private in society as free raw

43:51

material for translation into behavioral data

43:57

so just to take one of many examples you've probably all seen when

44:04

people let's say new mothers or new fathers share uh pictures of their

44:09

newborns maybe even share pictures of scans of their baby before the baby's

44:16

born social platforms encourage the sharing of those

44:21

data those kinds of pieces of content that in other times used to remain

44:28

private but those companies claim them as building blocks if you will raw

44:35

material that they can translate into behavioral data that they can then use to build models and say to advertisers

44:44

hey we can allow you to reach x million or 100 thousand people who have this

44:51

view who think like this who are in this circumstances who may be new parents uh

44:56

who may live in this part part of the country who may prefer this over that and so on and so on so surveillance

45:02

capitalism is this idea that we are being surveilled in a sense that our

45:09

data stuff about us that used to be considered private we're now encouraged to share

45:16

but then become the property of big Tech of social media for example who use

45:23

those private pieces of information as material to build models so that they

45:30

can sell advertising so it's a it's a little different tack on a similar observation that we've been making in

45:36

this whole unit this one called surveillance capitalism that's endless unit with some takeaways and further

45:43

thought political economists remind us that capitalism is not the same thing as

45:50

democracy even though some people would have us believe that but we cannot

45:56

according to a political economists understand our society or the health of our democracy without

46:03

emphasizing the role of capitalism in

46:09

it through this perspective of political economy this emphasizing of

46:15

capitalism we can make better sense of why digital media are the way they are

46:20

today and how we can improve them finally mcz notes

46:27

Society the general the the the well-being of our society and the political economy of the

46:33

internet because of our digital era the well-being of our society and

46:40

the political economy of the internet meaning the capitalism the the ramifications of capitalism in the

46:46

internet rise and fall together so important is capitalism in

46:53

understanding the D Revolution that capitalism as it affects digital tools

47:00

and the internet and the health of our society will rise and perhaps fall

47:07

together and of course remember that again political economy is consistent

47:13

with this critical perspective that we've been taking for the last few units

47:18

and that will end this unit thank you very much for listening and for watching
