0:02

0:49

quiz it will only cover this week's recorded lectures and assigned Media or

0:55

readings okay so last unit we were talking about particip atory culture

1:01

remember we had talked about three perspectives on digital culture that Scholars have taken over the years um

1:08

and the last one that we spent the most time on was participatory culture and participatory culture is not

1:15

a description of what we currently have everywhere on the internet it is not a

1:21

fact of Simply being online or being logged into a social media account

1:26

participatory culture describes a set of characteristics ICS and values that are

1:32

present in some online communities maybe some of yours but maybe not present in

1:38

some online communities so participatory culture is something to Aspire to let's review

1:45

quickly some of the characteristics it's a culture with low barriers to artistic

1:50

expression and Civic engagement when there is participatory culture among members there is strong support for

1:57

creating content and sharing cont content there is some type of not formal

2:04

mentorship in the sense of a official tutor or teacher but there's informal

2:10

mentorship there are norms there's ways that members of the community show one another what is acceptable and what is

2:17

encouraged there is when there is participatory culture members who believe their contributions matter and

2:24

members who feel some degree of social connection with each other so there's an important aspect of sociality in

2:32

participatory communities in participatory cultures online and don't

2:37

forget those two values that are stressed that are found when there is participatory culture

2:45

online those values the most important of which are democracy and diversity

2:50

here those two terms mean something particular democracy uh means that

2:56

everybody in the community at least feels they have a chance of having their voice heard diversity means that there

3:02

are lots of different types of people and lots of different types of voices and opinions in the

3:09

community so those values are what we aspire to when we aspire to have

3:17

participatory communities and participatory cultures

3:24

online sometimes participatory online communities Center on or invoke politics

3:33

and Civics take a few seconds to glance at these examples the recent ones um the

3:41

ways that people are changing their uh their online profiles to support uh for example either um Palestine or

3:50

Israel a famous uh example of a uh of a participatory um campaign that led to

3:57

results was the marriage equality campaign screenshot of which you see in the bottom left and then some of you may

4:04

remember that a few years ago in the wake of the murder of George Floyd uh there was online what was called a

4:10

hashtag blackout Tuesday where some people uh placed uh rectangular or Square black boxes over their accounts

4:17

to silence content of course that was controversial because it then silenced other types of content as well so

4:25

sometimes participatory cultures and communities or at least communities that could be participatory sometimes these

4:32

invoke or Center on politics or Civics and you've all probably seen

4:39

examples like these or something else that's somewhat similar social justice racial justice issue being invoked

4:46

online and maybe you've been a part of some of these movements yourselves in terms of posting content or using a

4:53

hashtag or changing your profile pick what do you think are those kinds of

4:58

efforts on online curating or posting content in a

5:04

way that invokes politics or Civics in some way do you think that those efforts

5:10

are examples of valid political participation or do you think that

5:17

there's a lot of noise about not much those examples are actually more like slacktivism or clicktivism and not

5:24

meaningful participation what do you think if you want to pause this and and reflect on

5:29

that for a few seconds please feel free to we'll revisit this question after the

5:35

content of today's unit because today we're going to be delving into what is called participatory politics and that

5:42

is thinking about involvement in politics through the lens of

5:47

participatory culture the culture that we discussed in the last unit and that you read

5:54

about so here's what we're going to do today we'll Define our key term and

6:00

concept here participatory politics we'll talk through some basics of understanding this perspective this

6:08

framework this concept and we'll talk about some forms that we see of

6:14

participatory politics and will end with a case study of a participatory

6:20

political movement the dreamer movement a campaign that is done in support of or

6:26

trying to get people to pass the DREAM Act so with a case study of the dreamer

6:32

movement before we move any further I want to Define politics in a way that

6:38

may surprise some of you because oftentimes when I talk to students about

6:44

politics they're not that interested in it they think that it's all just wonky stuff it's all gridlocked minutia

6:52

Antiquated stuff that is not much of interest to them and does not have much

6:58

relevance to them let me give you a definition of politics that I hope uh

7:03

would change people's mind if you for example one of those people who thinks politics doesn't matter to you

7:09

activities that engage people in attempts to acquire maintain and exercise power and control over

7:18

others because when we talk about politics the attempt uh as a as an

7:25

institution political institutions Politics as an activity politic IAL campaigns we're actually talking about

7:33

power who gets to use power who gets to acquire power who gets to keep power and

7:40

then by definition who doesn't get to use power who doesn't get to acquire

7:45

power who doesn't get to maintain power if they have it at all so politics is

7:51

really important to all of us because what we're talking about is who gets to have and use power and so take a look at

8:00

this screenshot uh that you see in front of you when for example the State of

8:05

Florida or since the uh Supreme Court um dismantled roie Wade uh that um

8:12

guaranteed the right to abortion to all Americans states have been making their own laws on this matter through

8:19

political processes right and so take for example Florida which has recently

8:26

had uh its abortion B go into effect prohibiting abortion after six weeks of

8:32

pregnancy where it used to be 15 weeks even in that state a lot of women don't know that they're pregnant after six

8:39

weeks of pregnancy and so what we're talking about here in terms of Florida

8:45

passing this law is a matter of power who should decide what women can and

8:51

can't do with their bodies who should decide under what conditions and when

8:57

those decisions can be made so when we're talk about politics we're talking about power and that is why even

9:04

if you're not a political junkie like I am I study strategic communication and politics uh we should all be aware of

9:11

the consequences of political decision-making and processes which is who has and who doesn't have power in

9:18

society there is a kind of conventional wisdom in political science as you all

9:25

know political science is a separate discipline to communication although related

9:33

obviously the department of political science and many universities for example right so there's a kind of

9:38

long-standing conventional wisdom um a long-standing accepted school of thought

9:45

that a lot of young people like many of you don't care about politics don't get

9:50

involved in politics and are just apathetic don't care about anything that is of significance to society in that

9:57

way young people don't vote much compared to older folks they just are dialed out don't care are

10:04

disaffected just kind of sitting on the sidelines that's the kind of long-standing viewpoint held in

10:11

political science that really um kind of came about in the uh in the

10:16

1990s when a guy um wrote a book a really F famous political scientist um

10:23

wrote a book called bullying alone and in that book the argument was

10:28

that um young people and citizens just in general are joining less groups not

10:34

joining political campaigns not joining bowling leagues not joining social groups that sometimes um invoke politics

10:41

or Civics and that people are just kind of isolated on their own watching TV and now uh using the internet so the book

10:49

bowling alone with seminal there and that old way of thinking really I say

10:55

old because there are newer ways of thinking for example in the discipline communication our discipline that takes

11:02

issue with that conventional wisdom that young people are apathetic don't care about

11:08

politics some scholars in the discipline of communication say hold on a second

11:13

maybe we're just going about thinking of the question in the wrong way maybe we shouldn't think about

11:20

political participation by those longstanding 60 70 year old measures for

11:26

example voting signing a petition volunteering for a campaign and so on

11:32

writing a letter to an editor maybe those are outdated ways of thinking about political

11:39

participation maybe instead we should think about the types of activities that

11:45

younger folks do actually engage in video game communities using memes

11:51

hashtags social media and think about when those accounts and those efforts

11:57

those groups when they reflect on politics or Civics

12:03

in some way on their terms maybe that's how we should think about political participation instead of those old tried

12:12

measures signing a petition volunteering for a campaign voting and so

12:18

on and that newer view is a view that we're going to talk about today and we

12:23

can call that participatory politics participatory politics

12:30

and this Viewpoint is set out really well by again Henry Jenkins We've ran into his uh work now a few times in this

12:37

course already Henry Jenkins along with several other co-authors wrote this book called

12:44

by any media necessary the new youth activism that talks about how young

12:52

people use digital tools communities social media on their terms in their

13:01

ways to show evidence of activism to engage in social justice protests for

13:08

example on their terms and they called the book by any

13:13

medium necessary right so any kind of media that necessary to accomplish their goals they're going to use so it's a new

13:20

way of looking at political participation that rejects that old tried idea that young people don't care

13:28

about politics according to traditional measures let's delve further into this

13:35

concept of participatory politics well here's how we can Define it the ways that the mechanisms of

13:43

cultural participation get harnessed for political purposes where is much of our cultural

13:49

participation these days of course it is online it manifests in digital culture

13:56

as we've been talking about now in this week units as I mentioned a few minutes ago a

14:04

really prominent early example was the campaign to achieve marriage equality

14:09

when many people for example changed their profile picks to this equal sign you may remember this those were very

14:16

important aspects of participatory politics that helped to achieve the

14:21

constitutional right uh to or I should say at least the um the Supreme Court

14:27

ruling that same sex couples had the right to

14:32

marry let's go deeper into the concept of participatory politics and understand some more Basics about

14:39

it participatory politics Taps into what young people like many of you already

14:45

known not what should be known for example by getting taught by a professor

14:53

or instructed by a campaign manager but Taps into what people already know

14:59

as the starting point for political action participatory politics may

15:05

involve what is called the Civic imagination the relationship between the acts of the

15:11

imagination and origins of political Consciousness to put that kind of away

15:16

from academic speak the idea here is that oftentimes to be able to achieve a different future

15:24

politically one has to dream one has to imagine a better life and sometimes those imaginations in our time often

15:31

times usually they take the form of content that we put out online in participatory

15:38

communities Henry Jenkins starts out his book the cover of which I just showed you with an example of Civic imagination

15:45

from his time when he was growing up uh many decades ago in the 50s and 60s in a

15:50

small town a rural town uh in America that didn't have many people of color

15:57

but Henry Jenkins who writes a about pop culture and digital pop

16:02

culture when he and people like him watched the TV show Star Trek the

16:07

original one that came out in the 60s one of the interesting things about Star Trek is that it featured a very diverse

16:15

true the Enterprise did compared to what was understood to

16:20

be mainstream America at the time again the the 1950s and early 1960s you had an African-American uh

16:29

crew member you had an Asian crew member you had Spock who was another species

16:36

entirely so seeing on TV seeing in pop culture that degree of diversity in the

16:43

show I have to remember again we're talking about the 1950s 1960s uh in Rural America in a small

16:51

town that had an impact on people like Henry Jenkins that allowed people like him to imagine a different Society a

16:58

better society that was more diverse had more different kinds of people in

17:05

it so the Civic imagination can be important in participatory politics this

17:11

idea that sometimes dreaming imagining a different society and future and in our

17:19

time creating content about that can be very important not just something to be

17:24

ignored but actually really important and may even be the origins of iCal Consciousness caring about politics

17:32

about Civics another uh point about participatory politics is that

17:39

participants in these communities often use and have an artistic side they make

17:44

and share media remember we talked about

17:50

participatory culture did not start with digital

17:56

platforms one example of a participatory culture culture that existed before the internet became widespread and popular

18:04

was a feminist movement named Riot girl sometimes these uh this movement was

18:09

called third wave feminism the space reclaiming 9s Punk movement that

18:16

originated uh in Olympia Washington the Seattle Washington Pacific Northwest

18:23

area and there you can see that the subhead subhead in this article now really tells you what we need to no we

18:29

are angry at a society that tells us girl equals dumb girl equals bad girl equals weak and especially in rock music

18:36

those tended to be very malale dominated um masculine and maybe even misogynistic

18:42

spaces and the riot girls this feminist movement wanted to do something about it

18:48

so this was a participatory community that existed before the internet and media was very important to them first

18:55

in the obvious way in the sense that they were a rock band so they made and put out music but also they published

19:03

zen zen are kind of DIY magazines that groups used to put out a

19:09

type of media that groups would put out before the internet so if you take a a few seconds to uh to glance at this

19:18

these are examples of media that the feminist movement Riot girl put out in

19:25

the 1990s more recently we could identify in our

19:31

time examples of art being important with regard to participatory politics

19:36

for example in the account of someone on Instagram named Tony McDade so I'll show you a couple of examples of uh his art

19:44

put out on Instagram so putting out media different

19:51

forms of media art can be a very important aspect of participatory

19:57

politics I another important aspect of polit participatory politics is that

20:03

many of the exchanges that somehow invoke politics are through not formal learning

20:10

communities like political campaigns or a class in political science at a

20:15

university but rather through informal learning communities for example those

20:21

communities that Center on fan pages or fandom or video

20:26

gaming so to give you some examp Le of fan pages here are three screenshots the

20:32

first one on the top left is a fanfiction site for Harry Potter the one

20:37

on the right is a fanfiction site for that um series that many of you have probably read and seen Twilight and the

20:45

bottom left is a a platform that hosts many different fan sites uh Archive of

20:52

Our Own and the interesting thing about these sites I myself am not a member of One I'm I'm I would bet probably a few

20:58

of you have have been on uh active in fanfiction sites but many times these fanfiction

21:04

sites they do invoke in some way matters related to society politics Civics so to

21:13

give one example one could analyze and write about uh the representation of

21:19

minorities in the Harry Potter books and movies or one could think about what

21:24

symbolically the arrival of the vampires in Twilight really means are they a metaphor for immigrants or migrants or a

21:33

group of you know a group of people of color for example so oftentimes these fanfiction

21:41

sites do take up matters that while they wouldn't be interesting or relevant to a

21:47

traditional view of political science and political participation they are very meaningful for this view we're

21:52

taking today of participatory politics gaming is another or video game

21:59

worlds there another important informal learning community that is important in participatory politics for example those

22:07

communities that are part of uh massively multiplayer online roleplaying

22:14

games or morgs wow or World of Warcraft is a well-known example of one of these kinds

22:21

of games and these we'll look more about that in just a second but these gaming

22:27

communities often become important informal spaces that contain

22:32

participatory politics another uh important

22:39

form uh of participatory politics is sharing information through social

22:45

media uh and one example of this this is kind of a participatory community that

22:51

is on the more organized side and I ask you to explore this phandom Ford site uh

22:58

YouTube page for your assignment but the fandom Ford group formerly the Harry

23:05

Potter Alliance is a really prominent participatory political group that is

23:12

prominent in social media especially YouTube let's watch a little bit of this video hi everybody I'm Katie and I'm

23:19

Jana and we're from fandom forward hold on didn't we used to be the Harry Potter

23:26

Alliance we still are phandom forward is the new name for the

23:31

Harry Potter Alliance a nonprofit that's been turning fans into Heroes for over

23:36

15 years we got our start in 2005 using Harry Potter as inspiration to talk to

23:42

fans and mobilize them around real world social justice issues we did that

23:48

because we love the books and the community that grew up around them and we still do but anybody who's been

23:55

following our work knows that we've been working with with other fandoms for over 10 years it's true we've run campaigns

24:03

and created tools using Star Wars Black Panther Wonder Woman The Hunger Games and literally a dozen more we're still

24:11

going to work with all the stories that you know and love and we really needed our name to reflect that and I know

24:17

you're wondering is this because of the author's transphobic words and actions or the treatment of people of color in

24:23

the series and in part yeah those factors weighed really really heavily in

24:29

this decision but also wizard activists have been talking about a name change

24:34

since at least 2012 in fact over a thousand of you

24:40

waigh in on this year's name change decision and literally

24:45

99% of you voted in favor of a name change that's huge for over 10 years

24:52

we've been organizing with an incredible diverse community of fans from inside and out of Harry Potter it's time for

25:00

our name to reflect and welcome our full incredible Community I'm going fan of

25:06

all right I'll stop it there in the interest of time um but this is an example uh of how a very organized

25:13

participatory political group called fandm Ford that used to be named a Harry

25:18

Potter Alliance uses social media in this case YouTube so this is one of their important videos that explains to

25:26

uh people why they ch change their name to Phantom Ford and what they

25:32

do hi everybody I'm another example of a form that

25:39

participatory politics takes is when there is the engagement in online

25:46

conversations through digital forums blogs and podcasts so here you can see

25:53

an example of podcasts that according to this author

25:58

of this piece was taking a Fresh Approach to the me too movement so these are different podcasts that take on the

26:06

issue of um sexual misconduct so forums blogs podcasts are

26:13

also important um forms of participatory politics online

26:20

videos and memes to comment on current issues are also important forums that

26:27

participate politics States so the phandom Ford

26:32

video would be an example of this as well also right an online video because YouTube is both both a video sharing

26:38

site and a social media Network let's watch another online video

26:44

at least a bit of it that is an interesting example from one of these informal learning communities um a

26:53

massively multiplayer game wow World of Warcraft so this is a video in which a

27:01

Guild Master Guild Masters are um guilds I don't play WoW but um I understand

27:06

what guilds are there are groups that are formed with the goal of carrying out raids in the game

27:13

World these guilds have leaders so this is a a video that the The Guild Master

27:20

from one particular Guild um put out uh on YouTube let's watch just a little bit

27:26

of this one share one of the most celebrated things

27:31

that I value here in the World of Warcraft well not just the World of Warcraft but gaming in general U just

27:38

the ability and the opportunity to have been part of or to have led this small

27:44

community of mine that without it I don't think or I'm pretty sure that my

27:49

that my wow experience would be uh it would be much less awesome than it is today I think that's like saying that

27:56

everything is totally awesome that absolutely nothing's wrong no no no no no no no so sit back for a little bit

28:02

have a listen I'm not going to have a lot of visuals I'm just going to talk about the things that I've learned being

28:09

a Guild Master for the past 11 years one we are definitely a social Guild uh the

28:15

the kind of Guild that I run I I I guess if I were to describe it it's like oh it's a it's a social Guild that happens

28:21

to do like heroic rating and that sort of thing um that's and that kind of sums

28:26

up a lot of it I mean first and foremost we consider ourselves I guess some of us inside would consider ourselves friends

28:33

and family when because when the raid's over when the Mythic dungeon thing has expired and the tier's done and we're

28:40

waiting for the next expansion we're we might still be in the same Guild and that's something that over the course of

28:46

all these years I've been watch and people come and go and come back again and leave and so on so forth so the

28:53

first and foremost that that's something that that that I've taken into account that the draw of coming in here isn't so

29:00

much hey we do heroic raids on these days and these nights I mean that's a big draw but and I'll talk about that in

29:07

a little bit but first and foremost it's a social Guild it's where people like-minded people can get along and

29:14

from that of course comes for comes some different caveats and advantages and

29:19

disadvantages to that but I definitely feel that over time we we've come to be

29:25

a social Guild uh first and foremost I think without that opportunity to just kind of break away from the game game

29:31

and just kind of talk smack uh and and shoot the [ __ ] that it would feel much

29:37

too rigid it would feel too businesslike and and without that um you know without

29:43

that kind of transaction outside of the game experience would it just wouldn't feel it just wouldn't feel good and

29:50

clearly I'm not phoning this video in new sir lesson two micromanaging does

29:55

not work well I all right I'm GNA stop it there also in the interest of time um

30:01

I don't want these recordings to be too long so this is uh A Guild Master a long

30:07

time I think 11year Guild Master talking about lessons that he's learned as the head of this um wellestablished Guild

30:16

and the first lesson was that the guild although ostensibly about raids is

30:23

actually first and foremost a social space talked about importance of

30:28

socializing the fact that the guild okay yes well it wouldn't exist without the objective of rating but it was first and

30:36

foremost a way for people to socialize and second lesson there the one that I stopped just after he related it uh was

30:45

that micromanaging wasn't good for him to do as the Guild Master and if IID

30:52

played it longer he'd go on and talk about how well he learned basically that it wasn't a good idea to tell you know

30:58

up on people always and micromanage say you have to do this this this but not this and this and not this and so he

31:04

needed to allow people to have their freedom to be themselves within this Guild but still work together to

31:09

accomplish the objectives now why do I show this and talk about it this is not a class on on video gaming or World of

31:17

Warcraft because while political science or traditional view of political

31:23

participation may say you know what what what why is this important it's not

31:28

talking about campaigning or it's not talking about petitions or voting but it

31:34

is important because if you think about some of those do this learned that

31:40

organizations they have their stated objective but are importantly social opportunities first or that it's

31:48

important for the leadership not to micromanage those same lessons could apply to a political Justice movement a

31:57

social justice movement a protest organization one that works to Advocate

32:03

one Pol to elect one politician over another so from the standpoint of participatory politics these kinds of

32:10

insights from informal communities like gaming worlds can actually be very

32:18

important this is an example of a meme that can be an important form of uh of um of political partic

32:28

ipation and this is an example of when you may remember this that happened a few years ago uh when this massive

32:36

container ship called the everg given blocked the Suez Canal Suez Canal is one

32:43

of those um shipping canals that makes it possible for container ships massive

32:49

ships to get from one part of the world to another uh you know where there where

32:55

there's land masses in the way a canal was made to allow a ship to get from one part of the another Suez Canal is one of

33:01

those really important canals and so this huge uh container

33:06

ship which is the size of something like four or five football fields it ran a

33:13

drift and ran around and eventually blocked the canal blocked the canal for

33:20

a few days costing in that few day blockage of the canal ended up costing

33:26

many many many hundred of millions of dollars uh of lost money because it

33:34

stopped the shipping of containers from going through that canal and so this

33:42

person made a meme

33:47

comparing a Dei Workshop to this little construction tool this

33:55

Digger compared that to to the massive problem of systemic racism that we in

34:02

other countries have comparing that to this massive container ship that ran a

34:09

ground so it's kind of an interesting use of an event that happened in the world this blockage of the

34:16

canal using that uh and to comment on a matter related to politics and to Civics

34:24

comparing this futile seemingly futile effort at first to use a tiny tool to

34:29

dig out the massive five football ship comparing that to a Dei diversity Equity

34:36

inclusion Workshop in the face of this massive problem of systemic racism that we have so from the perspective of

34:43

participatory politics memes like this are important

34:48

forms another important form of participatory politics is to use micro blogs most

34:55

commonly Twitter what is now X to Rally a community towards Collective

35:01

action so this is the X account of the transgender equality the national Center

35:07

for transgender equality here's another example from X or Twitter this example

35:13

happened uh a year and a half or so ago uh which was when um the Tennessee State

35:20

Legislature voted to expel some young members who were uh on the more

35:26

politically Progressive side uh two uh uh members a black men

35:33

and uh and a and a woman um voted basically to shut them out to expel them

35:39

to lock them out for from participating even though these were elected state representatives from the state of

35:46

Tennessee this led to large protests that were documented on this micro blog X and then shared with the world so

35:54

micro blogs like X can be important with regard to participatory

36:01

politics this is a a slide that shows just how important what used to be

36:06

called Twitter was to the hashtag Occupy Movement I should just say the Occupy

36:13

Wall Street movement which was a very very um

36:19

attention uh getting movement uh 12 years 13 years

36:25

ago that wanted to bring attention to income inequality that started in lure

36:32

Manhattan and spread throughout the world and the hashtag occupy or Occupy Wall Street became really important in

36:39

terms of how people talked about this movement and how they organized to participate in the movement and you can

36:45

see here on the bottom right just how important uh the micro Blog Twitter or X

36:50

was to that movement because 83% of the mentions of hash occupy took

36:57

place on Twitter so it was an indispensable tool for that social

37:04

movement and finally a form of participatory politics is to build

37:09

databases to investigate an ongoing concern probably some of you refer to

37:15

databases uh for example to understand which companies you may want to buycott

37:20

boycott excuse me or which may for example be cited for

37:26

um animal rights violation something like that so this is just one website that maintains a list of boycotts to

37:34

inform followers as to which organizations which companies it recommends people stay away from because

37:40

of some perceived wrongdoing with regard to politics or current

37:46

events let's end this unit with a little case study that demonstrates participatory politics in a campaign

37:54

that was done uh by an an organiz ation called dream activist. org and dream

38:01

activists. org is an organization that works to try to advocate for the passing

38:07

of the DREAM Act the DREAM Act was a piece of legislation that was first introduced

38:13

more than 20 years ago to try to bring out of the shadows and give

38:21

legal standing to some young people who were

38:26

brought to this country without papers through no fault or decision of their own these people are known as

38:33

dreamers and if passed by Congress the DREAM Act would for example give um

38:41

residents legal residents rights to some and if certain parameters were met give

38:47

them a chance to work legally and over time if parameters were met apply for

38:54

legal citizenship in the form of not citizenship excuse me excuse me but a a green

38:59

card uh which gives you the right to live as long as you want to in the country and to work the DREAM Act um

39:08

once came close to passing but has never passed it still has not been passed to

39:13

this day so anyway this is an organization made up of activists who engage in participatory politics to

39:20

bring attention to this cause and to advocate for passage of the DREAM Act

39:26

let's watch um some of an example of a video uh that um was put out this is an

39:33

oldie but a goodie this video is called my name is Muhammad and I am undocumented let's watch some of

39:39

this hey everybody this is Mo from dream activist um for the past week and a half or so we've been asking for all of you

39:45

guys to share your stories and share your videos about coming out um and so I thought it was about time to step up and actually do one since it's about

39:51

Thursday night or Friday morning um so a little bit earlier Gabe posted his video Gabe from GI 2010 wooo and he he posted

39:59

his video and he said you know the most important thing for us to say is my name is and I'm undocumented and so that's

40:05

how I was going to start off my video um my name is Muhammad and I'm undocumented my parents immigrated from here from

40:11

Iran um which is on the other side of the world um when I was just 3 years old

40:16

you know going out High School I always knew I was undocumented but I never really understood what it meant until it was that time when everybody was

40:21

applying for colleges and I was watching all my friends and you know they were applying to these schools and these colleges and I had dreams of going there

40:27

as well as well but I knew because of my status I wasn't going to be able to go there um and I know that Rings true for

40:32

lots of you guys and when we hear your stories and when you email us it's the same thing that we hear from everybody um and so after high school I was I was

40:39

perfectly fine with you know saving my money going to a community college saving up my credit so that eventually one day I would be able to go to a

40:45

university um and I remember it was in it was in the summer of 2007 when that day came and I applied to the school I

40:51

applied to Eastern Michigan University um and I remember I went there and I was um sitting in the admissions counselor's

40:58

office and he came to me and he said you know Muhammad you're the kind of student that we want at this University you meet

41:03

all the grades you've done all this stuff you're you're amazing we're glad you came here um and so I remember he

41:08

gave me this piece of paper and he said you know this is your acceptance letter and I was looking at the piece of paper and I had my nine-digit number that was

41:15

on there it was my student ID number um and I remember I was looking at this piece of paper he handed me and I was

41:21

thinking to myself as he was talking about something about you know financial aid and things that I knew I wouldn't qualify for because of my status and I

41:27

was looking at this piece of paper and I was thinking that you know when my parents came here 20 years ago this is

41:33

the same kind of hopes and this is the same kind of dreams that they had in mind when they came here and I had that in my hands and I remember as I was

41:40

think looking at this piece of paper I was thinking you know there's been so many nights that my mom has been sitting at home crying thinking about you know

41:47

what have I put my kids through what have I had made them suffer through and as I was looking at this piece of paper

41:53

I was thinking that you know I'm going to finally be able to call my mom and say hey mom guess what but all of those

41:58

dreams and all of those things that you had there finally came true and it was all worth it and so as I was sitting

42:04

there looking at this piece of paper um this counselor I remember he was talking about you know you're going to be able to qualify for this financial aid and

42:10

all this other stuff and as he was talking I was just kind of like drowning him out and I was looking at my amazing piece of paper and my new n-digit number

42:17

um and so then he walked out of the room and he came back like 5 minutes later and he came back and he said you know

42:23

what Muhammad we made a mistake as we were looking at your appli we we we missed the box that you clearly

42:29

marked that you're not a citizen and so he said because of that mistake we're going to have to take your acceptance

42:34

letter away and so he took my acceptance letter away from me and he said because of I wasn't born here I wasn't good

42:40

enough for the University so this was around September of 2007 um in October of 2007 um there

42:48

was this thing called The Dream Act that was up for a vote and I'm sure all of you guys are familiar with the DREAM Act or else you wouldn't be looking at this

42:54

video right now um and so the DREAM Act came up for a vote and at that time there was 44 Senators that decided that

42:59

we didn't deserve a chance to go to college and so the DREAM Act failed um

43:04

around that same time I was you know thinking to myself like okay this is the somewhere I've grown up in this is where somewhere I thought I was always going

43:10

to live I was going to give back to my community um but at this point the DREAM Act wasn't a reality and so what do I do

43:16

do I leave um and so I realized that you know I couldn't I couldn't go back to Iran because I'm also gay and so going

43:22

back to Iran was just not a reality for me and so then I started talking with other undocumented students around the

43:28

country and started meeting other undocumented students and I started realizing that my situation was not unique just to me I was not the only

43:35

undocumented student out there there were so many other undocumented students that were going through the same exact thing that I was going through um and so

43:41

what we decided to do was all these other students we decided to come together and start an organization that would actually work for our rights and

43:48

so we started dream activist. org we started with prena in California with Maria in Pennsylvania with Juan in

43:55

Florida with Mark in California all right I'll start stop it there in the interest of time um so this is a um a

44:01

video an example of participatory politics part of a campaign done by this

44:08

organization dream activist. org to bring attention to their cause and also

44:14

uh to kind of come out of the shadows in a sense uh to come out to say to the

44:19

world my name is so and so and I am undocumented

44:27

there is at least one scholar Arley Zimmerman who has tried to conceptualize these particular kinds of participatory

44:34

political efforts done by these kinds of groups

44:40

like dream activist. org and is called this concept trans media testimonio in

44:45

which and here I'm reading for the from the abstract activists give accounts of their immigration experiences reveal

44:52

their legal status like we just saw and document their participation in Civil

44:58

Disobedience speaking of Civil Disobedience let's watch another group uh video from the group um dream

45:06

activist. org let's watch this

45:19

one last word take this I

45:27

47:09

47:15

47:21

Border what's it to you I'm going document too

47:34

47:59

so how did you get to the United States across the

48:05

border when did you do that long time ago you have any other idea with you no

48:13

not

48:44

all right so I don't show um these videos um with the intention of making a

48:49

political Point uh I'm showing these examples as they are examples of

48:54

participatory Politics the youth of digital media YouTube social media

49:01

and ways that invokes politics and

49:07

Civics what are some takeaways from this little case study that we uh are ending this unit with well first of all some

49:14

takeaways were that new tactics like Civil Disobedience that are documented through a smartphone and on

49:21

YouTube uh and uploaded to YouTube these emerged often these new tactics were

49:26

enacted through as we've been talking about in this unit digital media in different ways the DREAM Act was not and

49:33

still has not been passed by Congress however DACA was signed by President

49:39

Obama in 2012 DACA was an executive order deferred action on childhood

49:45

arrivals that gave some that that

49:50

delayed uh or or that that offset or delayed deportation

49:57

proceedings uh or any type of action for some dreamers which allowed them to come

50:03

out of the shadows and be given um the ability to live in this country legally

50:11

for a period of time had to be renewed uh and uh in some cases the right to

50:16

work for a period of time DACA is in legal limbo right now uh

50:23

it was supported by some administrations not others Donald Trump tried to end it uh Joe Biden is in favor of it so it's

50:29

kind of in legal limbo in the courts right now but perhaps most importantly a takeaway of the dreamer movement and

50:35

this example of an organized participatory political campaign is that

50:40

visibility was gained social digital media um these type of communities

50:46

allowed people to spread their word uh to gain visibility for themselves and

50:53

their causes outside of traditional formal organizations like political

51:00

campaigns for office let's end uh with returning to

51:06

this question that I asked at the beginning of this unit do you think doing things online posting a video

51:14

using a meme hashtag changing your profile pick to something to support a

51:20

social or racial Justice movement for example do you think now that those

51:25

examples are valid and important political participation or would you think that

51:32

those examples are much to do about nothing clicktivism or

51:39

slacktivism so I wonder uh if this unit has changed people's minds or solidified

51:45

people's opinions on that let's end with some takeways and

51:50

further thought for some people some observers participatory politics is

51:56

simply what activism looks like now especially young people many of them

52:02

aren't that concerned with signing a petition or contacting their representative or even voting but some

52:09

people make the argument that these examples of using social media for example is simply what involvement in

52:16

activism in politics looks like now for young people participatory politics May

52:22

benefit those who feel excluded from politics that it doesn't apply to them

52:27

that it doesn't take into account their views that it's not relevant to them these kinds of efforts like we've

52:34

discuss today May benefit those kinds of disaffected people like we said about participatory

52:40

culture it's important to beware of both utopian and dystopian discourses with

52:47

regard to participatory politics these aren't going to solve every problem in society they're also not going to ruin

52:54

society as we know it an important Point here made by Henry Jenkins is that participatory politics

53:02

cannot although it can be important and some of the examples we've seen are important but participatory politics

53:09

cannot overcome the structural inequalities that are barriers to part

53:15

political participation meaning when there is for example certain districts

53:21

and areas of town that are well resourced and others that are under

53:27

resourced or for example the problem of systemic racism in our justice system

53:34

political politics is participatory politics is important but cannot overcome those structural inequalities

53:41

that still exist and are still barriers to political participation and one final um Point

53:50

here today in this unit we've been talking about the intersection of media

53:55

often times digital media media and politics our lens today was

54:01

participatory culture and participatory politics but that isn't the only lens for thinking about the intersection of

54:07

media and politics for example I could teach a whole semester along class on

54:12

this topic in the ways that Howard Dean or Barack Obama or Donald Trump used

54:19

Twitter Facebook uh and other political platforms and how politicians are using

54:24

and will be using for example uh Tik Tock uh Ai and virtual

54:31

reality so there are many different ways to think about the in the intersection

54:36

of median politics in a limited class uh like this one um

54:42

our uh lens on the intersection of media and politics was participatory culture

54:48

and participatory politics but there are other ways of thinking about those

54:53

intersections all right that will be it for this unit thank you very much for listening and for watching
