# What is cancel culture (lol)

## Cancel culture
Collective strategies by activitsts using social pressures to acheive cultureal ostracism of targets (someone or something) accused of offensive words or deeds

## Holds people accountable by
- Damaging *reputations*
- Derailing *careers*
- Denying *access* to public platforms
- Establishing grounds for legal *prosecutions*
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617201758.png]]

Activists use *Collective expressions of outrage* over speech or actions judged morally inappropriate and offensive

Targets often *powerful public figures* widely regarded as transgressing acceptable moral standards of conduct

Many of these powerful figures appear *above reach of law* 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617201914.png]]

**Broader goals**: Share collective expressions of moral outrage, mobilize public opinion, and demand action from decision makers

# Caution!?!?!??!?!?!!
"*Public shaming* is *NOT* new"

# 2 perspectives opposing cancel culture

## Mob mentality and public shaming run amok?

### First perspective
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202252.png]]

silences free speech and open debate
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202321.png]]

Slippery slope silencing a variety of unpopular perspectives

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202454.png]]

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202525.png]]
May ultimately undermine tolerance of contrarians

May generate groupthink

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202727.png]]

Freedom of speech needed, especially for expression of unpopular and contrarian opinions

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202819.png]]

## A form of Empowerment?
### 2nd perspective
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617202905.png]]

Public shaming has a *legitimate role* e.g:
- Criticizing racial or homophobic slurs
- Highlighting unacceptable abuse of power
- Criticizing engagement in cultural appropriation
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617203026.png]]

Analysis of "*cancel culture*" must start with the **power relations** by which it is defined

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617203103.png]]

- Different groups don't always have a chance to have their voices heard..
- Marginalized groups will have themselves represented less than others

Effective tool for networked groups to achieve **social justice** and **cultural change**

- Especially for **marginalized groups** who are powerless to obtain legal changes or public apology

Originated in queer communities of color and popularized through **black twitter**

## Black twitter 
Network of culturally connected communicators using the platform to draw attention to issues of concert to black communities

Public figures **should** be held to account

**Cancelling** seen as a choice to withdraw attention from someone/something regarded as morally/ethically offensive

# The role of digital media
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617204039.png]]
c.c. GREW among decentralized networks of like-minded digital activists mobilizing around progressive social causes and uniting around hashtags, e.g.;   `#metoo and #BLM`
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617204147.png]]

"Viral" online posts with accusations spark coverage in mass media like cable TV, talk radio, and op-eds

Studies: intense culture wars arise in part because of **activists** connected through digital social networks (e.g. X/Twitter)

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617204405.png]]

politics of **outrage** thought to be reinforced by **filter bubbles** and **echo chambers** among like-minded people online

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617205600.png]]

Patterns of social media use expected to amplify reach and expand voice of **younger generations** 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240617205701.png]]
- Younger voices are going to be amplified because of the demographic of people who use the app
\
Online Tweets/posts amplified through interpersonal comm,m elite rhetoric, journalists and media commentators

# CAUTION!10348!??!?
Culture wars intensified by right-wing commentators on cable TV and talk radio and conservative newspapers in the UK

- Think of when social media became popular. 
- Roughly 15 - 20 years ago. Cancel culture is not new...
- Social media does not cause cancel culture

# Takeaways and further thought
- Many public figures aren't actually *cancelled*
- Digital media likely *reflect* and reinforce cancelation practices rather than *drive* them
- Whatever your perspective on C.C., understand there is a different view that warrants attention
- Both sides fuel the culture wars
- "*Cancelling*" - and its criticisms - are about **power**
