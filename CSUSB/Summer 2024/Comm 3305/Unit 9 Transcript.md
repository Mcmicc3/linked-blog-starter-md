0:03

hey everybody Welcome to Unit Nine artificial intelligence let's begin today with an

0:09

announcement first of all well actually the only announcement is that there's one remaining assignment left for this

0:15

course and that is your end term exam this exam is going to be shorter

0:21

than the midterm was because we're covering less units in this section of the course it will be 15 multiple choice

0:28

questions it will be 10 true false questions I'm still going to give you an hour uh to do it um so you'll have one

0:36

full hour to do it nobody should feel rushed it only covers material since the

0:44

midterm it only covers material since the midterm so it's not cumulative of

0:49

course it is open book and open note you can use your notes my slides for the

0:55

exam all unit recording since the midterms and all assign readings and media since the midterm are fair

1:03

game a reminder to please do your course evaluations AKA or Saudi uh that link

1:10

you'll find on canvas and please remember as you fill that out uh the unique nature of this course which is to

1:16

say it's a condensed course into only five weeks uh it is asynchronous online

1:22

we're not meeting in the classroom or in real time um but a lot goes a lot of thought and planning and preparation

1:27

goes into putting together um these courses and uh shaping the course to match the format of a summer class uh so

1:36

um I can assure you that your input is very valuable and that I will read through your comments very clearly of

1:43

course those comments and the evaluation uh in total is

1:48

anonymous all right so what do you think of when you hear or see the term

1:55

artificial intelligence what are some things that come to mind

2:00

if you want to hit pause on this recording and do a little brainstorming uh please feel free

2:07

to well for a lot of people they think of things like this

2:13

kind of dystopian stories of problems for Humanity and maybe even our world

2:21

our society our civilization ending that depiction of AI was

2:27

certainly the case for my generation when I was growing up and maybe some of yours captured in movies like The

2:34

Terminator remember we said that media and messages about technology tend to be reflective they reflect what people are

2:42

thinking about worrying about at the time and so their Terminator franchise and actually many other movies

2:48

positioned AI as a threat to humanity and was consistent with this

2:54

dystopia narrative that we are unable to stop change we are losing control in the case of the Terminator franchise the AI

3:03

self the AI defense network Skynet becomes self-aware and begins to see us

3:09

humans is a threat and launches nuclear weapons at US cities much more recently you may have

3:16

seen depictions of AI in movies like this one the Creator um which is a movie

3:21

uh that came out pretty recently and is in my mind at least a really interesting and good

3:27

movie there are some similarities between the depiction of AI and the Creator and those in franchises like the

3:34

Terminator that I just spoke about but in this one there's also some differences so this also does depict a

3:41

dystopian future of War involving AI but this movie actually asks us

3:49

something interesting which is surrounding the question of Ethics in this case which side is actually the ethical

3:57

side if it came to be that there was a war between humanity and AI which side

4:02

is actually ethical do we know that for sure can we take it for granted or is it possible that the AIS are more ethical

4:09

than humans so if you haven't seen the movie The Creator from the director of Rogue one as the subtitle said which is

4:16

also in my mind another really good movie uh do check out the Creator uh for fun on your own

4:22

time let's define AI artificial intelligence and here's a definition

4:27

from the University of North Florida the capacity of machines to

4:35

mimic human cognitive functions such as learning problem solving and pattern

4:43

recognition enabling those machines to perform tasks that normally require

4:49

human intelligence so it's when machines basically are able to do things that we

4:57

have usually or sometimes even exclusively thought of as

5:03

human the domain of our human intelligence our brains learning problem solving pattern recognition and to get

5:10

better at those things as they learn but our concern in an academic

5:19

class that is taking place in the school of communication studies Department of

5:25

communication studies as Scholars it's important that we think about how we can theorize

5:32

artificial intelligence theory as you all know sets the basis for research

5:37

theories help us ask and address questions that guide our research whether you're using quantitative or

5:44

qualitative methods in your research so how can we theorize

5:49

artificial intelligence from the perspective of our discipline the perspective of communication that is a

5:57

matter at hand in this course in our

6:02

department there is at least one scholar who has taken up this

6:08

Challenge and has drawn a distinction between AI theorized as

6:15

extraordinary which is the traditional way that Scholars and intellectuals have thought about

6:22

Ai and on the other hand AI as

6:27

ordinary let's first run through the first perspective which as I mentioned is the traditional perspective that has

6:33

been taken by Scholars intellectuals and also in culture over the

6:40

decades in this view a central question emerges with regard to AI what are the

6:47

implications for our Humanity so this tends to be a macr level perspective

6:53

that is concerned about human beings Humanity Society as a whole

7:00

this perspective asks or inquires as to what is at

7:07

stake what is at stake is that the very nature of who we are compared to

7:13

machines and what it means to be human what does it mean to be human versus a

7:19

machine to be human with a soul versus a machine without a sto at a soul so it's

7:26

a very sort of ontological and metaphysical question who are we as

7:33

humans this perspective places our Collective Humanity up for grabs our humanity is in

7:41

question because of the emergence of these intelligent machines AIS place our humanities up for

7:49

grabs in ways that can Elevate or destroy the human race depending on how

7:56

artificial intelligence is implemented and that should be ringing bells in your minds because yes whether or not a new

8:05

technology even one very very consequential L like AI is still subject to those utopian and

8:12

dystopian narratives technological determinism right that we talked about

8:19

earlier in the course so this traditional perspective

8:26

that intellectuals Scholars cultural critics have taken over the decades

8:31

tends to be a macro perspective that looks at the implications for Humanity

8:37

on a grand scale at a macro level and foregrounds the Very nature of what does

8:43

it mean to be human the very essence of what it means to be human versus a

8:51

machine this perspective holds that AI seeks to recreate part of us that we

8:57

have conceived tradition additionally as being uniquely human our

9:04

minds that is why so much has seen to be at stake from this perspective as AI

9:09

being extraordinary outside of the ordinary extraordinary AI has understood to be an

9:18

attempt and possible success at recreating what has often over the

9:23

centuries been thought of as uniquely human our minds that's part of this perspective is

9:30

captured well in a movie that we looked at in depth earlier in the course exmachina let's watch this scene called

9:37

session three when AA is talking to the protagonist of the movie

9:43

[Music]

9:58

[Laughter]

10:11

[Laughter]

10:24

[Laughter]

10:37

for [Music]

10:48

[Music]

10:55

[Laughter] [Music]

11:32

now open your

11:53

eyes how do I look look

12:11

good this is what I'd wear on our date right first a traffic

12:18

intersection then maybe a

12:25

show I'd like us to go on a date yep

12:31

yeah it'll be

12:38

fun are you attracted to me what are you attracted to me you give me indications

12:45

that you are I do

12:50

yes how micro Expressions micro Expressions the way your eyes fix on my

12:56

eyes and lips the way you hold my

13:03

gaze

13:15

don't do you think about me when we aren't

13:21

[Music] together sometimes at [Music] night I'm wondering if you're watching

13:28

me on the camera cameras and I hope you

13:35

are now your micro expressions are telegraphing

13:41

discomfort I am not sure you'd call them

13:48

micro I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable

13:57

[Music] all right so that is a scene from

14:04

exina and in this case in this particular

14:10

scene an aspect that has almost always you know previous to

14:18

the rise of intelligent machines been thought of as uniquely human is

14:26

seduction because seduction of course takes place in our minds and so that's

14:31

this idea that can AI create seduction in the protagonist

14:38

brain uh the can the AI seduce the protagonist that is something that has

14:45

previously been thought of as uniquely human and of course we can say the same

14:52

thing about the end of the movie we already watched this last scene in a previous unit when AI is actually excuse

14:59

me Ava is actually able to um to manipulate and trick the humans involved

15:06

and kill the Creator and Ava is able to emerge into the real world the world of

15:12

the living the world of the greens and the blues and of life and pass herself

15:19

off as a human being we assume the movie leads us to

15:24

assume so intelligent is the ai's mind

15:31

an example of this happening or the apparent ability of

15:36

AI to duplicate or reproduce what we've often thought of as uniquely human the

15:42

Mind an earlier incident in reality where this seemed to have happened at

15:48

least for some was when an early AI machine in the 1990s was able to beat

15:55

the best chess player in the world that's watch a wrap up of this incident that happened in

16:02

97 did we make a difference the world was paying a lot of

16:07

attention and we weren't quite used to that chess events never get covered like

16:13

that it was probably the biggest news coverage for a chess match ever we were

16:19

trying to prove that it was possible to build a chess machine that could beat the best human player in the world it's

16:26

also challenging Kasparov in any way I mean he's the Pinnacle of just he he

16:31

incredible [Music]

16:37

genius there were people who even just a few years before said it was going to

16:42

take decades to do the Chess World all expected Kasparov to win cuz the human

16:48

had always won [Music]

16:56

before we' worked very hard in the intervening year uh to improve deep blue

17:03

in various ways I spent a lot of time in the office playing a lot of practice games uh looking for lots of of errors

17:12

that needed to be fixed and and we were pretty confident that it would do better then we got to the match that was the

17:19

chance to see did we make a difference Gary has he was under tremendous stress

17:27

I I imagine the program wasn't behaving the way he was

17:33

[Music] expecting he thought that he was going

17:38

to figure out the computer and he he wasn't mentally prepared for it I think

17:43

I mean the whole game was surreal what was he doing it didn't really make any sense whoa deep blue has instantly

17:52

sacrifice with Knight captures E6 D BL just sitting there and just keep on

17:57

attacking just moving pieces around and he knew he was in trouble but at the end

18:03

Kasparov just he stands up he starts gesturing he looks over at his

18:08

mother I I think having your mother in the room where you're playing a important chess game is not a great idea

18:14

as much as I love my mom I was down founded and elated at the same time uh I

18:20

down founded because I never see him behave that way he never imagine the

18:25

world champion and actually somebody I have great respect to be just raising his hand up in in

18:32

[Music]

18:38

surrender we we demonstrated that there are multiple approaches to solving

18:43

probably any intellectual problem but back then it wasn't the case everybody would look at the computer and say well

18:49

yeah it's good at some things it it calculates but it doesn't understand anything I work on this for 12 years so

18:57

you can imagine how how much energy would went into it when I started I was like it was D in 5 to 10 years I was

19:03

wrong it it took 12 so I I was great was over

19:08

[Music] really all right so that's a news wrap up uh of the time in 1997 when an

19:16

intelligent machine was able to beat the world's best chess

19:25

player another aspect of this theoretical position of the AI as being

19:31

extraordinary that is important is something called the talk of AI and that is how do various

19:39

institutions and important people in society talk about AI for example media

19:45

representations we just uh watched one in terms of the um news report of the

19:50

intelligent chess playing machine in addition to you can consider um movie

19:56

representations of AI That's part of it but also how scientists discuss it and we saw an example of the scientist at

20:02

the end he said we thought it would take 3 four years to build this AI capable of beating the world's best chess player it

20:08

actually took 12 years so one interesting or one important aspect of

20:13

this theoretical position is what is the talk of the AI how do cultural

20:18

institutions like the media and experts like scientists talk about AI another

20:25

important way that we can think about this perspective and even summarize this

20:31

perspective is by thinking of the Mind as machine and its inverse the machine

20:37

as mind what do we mean by that metaphors in which the nature of the

20:43

human mind and the nature of the machine are being compared to make excuse me a

20:49

con a conceptual connection between the two so from this traditional

20:57

longstanding understanding and theoretical position of artificial intelligence there's a coupling of the

21:03

human mind and the Machine which you can see the screenshot on the bottom right there is the title of at least one movie

21:11

so this movie being an example of talk of AI as well as demonstrating through its title the coupling of the mind and

21:18

machine in the way that AI has traditionally been conceptualized over

21:24

the decades another aspect of this

21:30

understanding of AI as extraordinary is that the AI

21:37

technology and their function the specific Technologies themselves and the way that they function are usually

21:44

described in human terms sometimes this is called

21:49

anthropomorphism so for example when you see like objects or animals described in human terms that's called

21:57

anthropomorphism we've done that same thing over the decades with AI and so here you see a screenshot from that

22:02

movie that I talked about a few minutes ago the Creator where this child as you watch the movie you'll

22:09

understand is revealed to be the most important kind of controller of the AI

22:16

um Universe in that movie so the screenshot is kind of ising in two ways number one the sort of core

22:24

or Center or controller of the AI in that story world is is child that's the most you know human

22:31

terms right but also you can see how members of the other characters other

22:37

members of the uh cast treat the AI as a child that needs to be protected so from

22:45

this long-standing positioning of AI as extraordinary it tends to be viewed in

22:53

anthropomorphic or anthrop with an anthropomorphism in other words describe

22:58

in human terms so that when you take all this together the mind is machine

23:05

machine as the Mind what's at stake is the very nature of humanity

23:11

anthropomorphism when you take all this together what is clear is that over the decades artificial intelligence by

23:19

critics intellectuals Scholars is conceptualized as something of a myth a

23:25

myth a story that is told so that

23:32

AI is both a technological pursuit to build more and more intelligent machines

23:38

and it's also a philosophical and sometimes Mythic

23:46

Endeavor however there are some problems with this long-standing positioning as

23:51

AI of AI as extraordinary outside the

23:56

ordinary something that makes us question our very Humanity the mind and machine there are some problems with

24:03

that perspective well first of all this theoretical lens as of AI as

24:11

extraordinary is old it began in the mid

24:17

1900s the conference of intellectuals and Scholars that is credited with really originating thinking about AI was

24:25

this confidence whose preview you see on the screen organ ized by Dartmouth College in 1955 a proposal for the

24:31

Dartmouth summer research project on AI so this theoretical lens that we've been

24:37

discussing that AI is extraordinary originated from the

24:44

1950s another problem with this positioning is that metaphors connecting the body and the Machine are

24:51

clumsy they tend to essentialize or be reductive in terms of their

24:57

generalizations so that's a clumsy metaphor another problem is that anthropomorphic

25:03

portrayals that is describing AI in human terms don't account for differences in artificial intelligence

25:10

as compared to our human

25:17

traits another important problem with this understanding of AI of of AI excuse

25:22

me as extraordinary is that it focuses too much on the AI techn ologies of a

25:29

fictional tomorrow so many of the understandings of AI that have existed for decades have still not come to

25:37

pass so that begs an important question what about the AIS that we in

25:43

our time now use every day in mundane aspects of everyday life what about

25:51

those increasingly frequent daily regular

25:57

interactions with AI can those be understood under this theoretical

26:02

umbrella that is AI is extraordinary take a look at some of these

26:08

Technologies Voice assistance the Google

26:13

search uh algorithm filters on Tik Tock driverless

26:21

cars I've seen a few of these recently here in California and just social media

26:27

in general because the way that the social media algorithms work they are a

26:32

kind of AI they learn about you to to give you uh what it thinks are are

26:39

better or we can say more profitable from the perspective of political

26:45

economy content when you're on those platforms so what about these more

26:52

everyday uses of AI and yes chat GPT

26:58

a form of generative AI could be included in a kind of AI that many

27:04

people are using regularly on a regular

27:09

basis that question LED Guzman scholar that I'm drawing from to put together

27:16

this presentation to propose a different theoretical understanding of artificial

27:23

intelligence instead of that longstanding position of AI being EXT

27:30

extraordinary mind and machine machine and mind what is the nature of the

27:35

implications to the very core of humanity itself instead to conceptualize

27:40

AI not as extraordinary but rather as

27:46

ordinary from this perspective AI is conceptualized each individual AI tool

27:52

is a type of Communicator so that interact s with

27:59

devices and programs are a form of

28:06

communication the machine whether that is a voice assistant like Siri whether

28:12

that is chat GPT whether that is a Google search uh algorithm and uh and

28:20

opportunity YouTube social media the machine the tool the platform becomes a

28:26

kind of communication partner with the user and so to conceptualize AI as

28:35

ordinary The Scholar Guzman proposes four steps or four

28:41

dimensions First Dimension or step is to ask where does the technology the

28:47

individual technology in question fit in with artificial intelligence as a whole

28:52

for example who are the founders of the individual tool or Tech what is it

28:59

purpose how does it function what is the level of intelligence involved some AIS

29:04

are much more advanced in terms of their learning capacity than others so the First Dimension or step is

29:11

to think about where the individual technology fits in with AI as a category

29:18

of tools second what are the aspects of people's direct interactions with the AI

29:25

technology that inform their understanding of it for example how do

29:31

users interact with it what is the interface that allows the users to interact with it

29:39

like third what kind of messages are

29:44

circulating in society about the specific technology in question and

29:50

about AI in general so that requires we understand how that technology and AI generally are

29:57

depicted in culture in media like TV and movies in addition to understanding and

30:03

studying how specific AI Technologies are

30:09

marketed and fourth what are users own interpretations of the AI technology are

30:16

there some tools that some users may think is are actually not artificial intelligence versus others that do is

30:22

there a trend in terms of what tools people consider intelligent and what people consider

30:29

unintelligent so what are users own interpretations of the AI technology and that step four that fourth dimension

30:36

would require things like focus group research to really hammer out what individual people think and understand

30:44

about that technology so what if we were to apply these steps or Dimensions to chat GPT

30:51

let's quickly walk through this and I won't spend too much time on this I want to keep this reporting short what is the Tech fit in within AI

30:59

as a whole well we know that chat gbt was founded by certain individual I'm

31:06

forgetting his name right now um it is a type of generative AI which means it

31:11

generates content not all kinds of AI generate content some do right and this

31:17

is a debate that we're having right now in in Academia as to how should we as uh

31:23

faculty uh react when students are trying to submit content that's generated from

31:30

AI what is the purpose right how does it function what is the level of

31:35

intelligence involved in terms of chat GPT second dimension or step what are

31:42

the aspects of people's direct interactions with the AI Tech that inform their understanding how do people

31:48

use chat GPT they use it on their phones do they use it on their laptops what is

31:54

the interface like can they use voice commands can they cut and paste how much

32:00

text can be cut and paste into chat GPT so that an desired result is

32:08

returned third what kind of messages in in general in society are circulating

32:15

about in this case chat GPT and this is an interesting one right is chat GPT

32:21

construed as something that is a productive tool is it something that is construed

32:28

how is it construed in Academia is it going to be construed as something that students used to

32:34

cheat how will chat GPT be construed depicted represented in movies and TV

32:40

shows I saw and probably some of you have seen a really funny an interesting uh South Park episode uh centering on

32:48

chat GPT where uh one of the boys uses chat

32:53

GPT to um basically reply to texts from his

32:59

girlfriend that he doesn't feel like answering and it becomes widely used in the school how is chat GPT being marketed

33:06

I've seen at least um one uh piece of marketing um that is speaking of

33:13

marketing encouraging people to use chat GPT to brainstorm ads and marketing to

33:19

create copy to create ads to create content that can be used as part of for example advertising campaigns and fourth

33:26

what are users own interpretations of the AI technology in this case of chat GPT and in this case I can draw directly

33:35

on your discussion responses and many of you interestingly

33:41

raised questions surrounding

33:46

authenticity is chat GPT is a communication partner from this perspective of AI as ordinary is it an

33:54

authentic extension of the individual or does it compromised authenticity because

33:59

it's returning things that are beyond the everyday scope or beyond the pattern

34:07

or style or tone of the individual User it's really interesting how many people noted authenticity or or qualiity

34:14

similar to authenticity in their discussion and responses so briefly that would be a way

34:21

that we would apply these four dimensions or steps from this theoretical perspective that a is

34:28

not extraordinary but rather ordinary to chat GPT the generative AI

34:36

technology your assigned uh your assignment for this unit is to watch

34:42

this Ted Talk what is an AI anyway from Mustafa solaman I'm not going to take time to

34:48

play it now but uh please make sure you do watch that Ted Talk that's a strong hint that you will see at least one exam

34:55

questions on this Ted Talk pay particular attention to how trulon is

35:01

conceptualizing AI and I'll give you a hint or remind you that it is not a

35:07

comparison that we have discussed in this unit as yet it's something different how does Mustafa solaman

35:15

conceptualize AI let's end this uh intentionally

35:23

shorter unit with some takeaways and further thought well first of all AI has

35:28

sometimes over the decades remember our understanding and thinking about AI

35:34

really began in the 1950s AI has sometimes been thought of as a savior and as a destroyer of humanity and yes

35:42

that is directly applicable to what we talked about earlier in the course with regard to technological determinism and

35:49

utopian and dystopian narratives artificial intelligence has

35:55

traditionally often normally been theorized as extraordinary been theorized for its

36:02

implications for Humanity on that macro level and has often been theorized in the context of the future what could

36:10

happen in terms of very intelligent machines for Humanity as we have seen in

36:16

this course represented in the movie exmachina but this conceptualization of

36:24

AI as extraordinary is one way to describe that these are my words or this is my word not Guzman's word this

36:30

conceptualization is stale it's existed since people started thinking and dreaming about AI in the

36:38

1950s and so that led to Guzman to propose that other theoretical model that AI can be understood as ordinary

36:46

rather than extraordinary but our AI artificial intelligence especially very ADV

36:53

Advanced ones are they really ordinary or does this other second alternate

36:59

theoretical framework of AI is ordinary does this miss their transformative

37:04

potential those are that is a question for us to keep in mind as we go

37:10

forward that is it for this unit thank you very much for watching and listening
