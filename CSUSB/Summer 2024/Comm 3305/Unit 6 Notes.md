## Personal vs Social Identity
Personal identity (distinguish us from others)
Social identity (define us as group members: voluntary or involuntary)

## Disembodied Identity: separate from the body

# Identity: 3 Types

## 1. Subjectivity (How we think of ourselves)

## 2. Representation (How different facets of identity are depicted in culture and media)

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619222338.png]]
## 3. Self Presentation (how we present ourselves to others)

### Some scholars:
Comm. without traditional identity cues might enable people to experiement with **different identities** and **personalities**, making it obvious that these categories were **social constructions**. 
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619222743.png]]

## Why did the internet as "identity workshop" NOT happen?

1. People did **not** create radically different selves online
2. Discrimination is **not** solely based on appearance
3. Commercial software steer us to a single, fixed identity

## Approaches to identity construction
1. Identity as **fixed** or **static**
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619223133.png]]
2. Identity as **flexible** and **changeable**
	- People present themselves differently based on **context** (where they are) and **audience** (who they are with)
	- Multiplicity is an **inherent** property of identity **rather** than dishonest or fake
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619223339.png]]
3. Identity as constructed through **discourse** and **social processes**
- E.G. gender/race are **social constructed** and **performative**
- E.G. gender/race are **ideological** (to maintain or further a particular balance of power)

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619223754.png]]
4. Identity as a **project**
	- People construct (or actively work on) identities for themselves using **Mass Media** and **Consumer Goods**

- Wearing these type of glasses make them look smarter (lol)

"Identity can be worked on and improved." 

# How are identities constructed online?
1. What we choose to show
2. Interacting with others
3. Customization (e.g. in social media): **digital tokens** that become symbolic markers of identity
4. Every digital piece of info a person provides!
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619224241.png]]

## How does online identity construction vary?
1. Technological **affordances**
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619224316.png]]
- Youtube affords the ability to make playlists based on topics
2. Idioms of practice: set of norms around the use of tech
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619224501.png]]
- Breaking up with some over online status, or a phone call
3. Different types of software/platforms invoke different social contexts
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619224559.png]]4. Perception of the audience

## Identity and **difference**
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619233946.png]]
Uses **Categories** e.g. ethnictiy, gender, sexuality, class, ability

### Intersectionality
Multiple [stable] overlapping facets of identity and how they affect experience of power and privilege

### Assemblage
A grouping of interwoven pieces; identity as an unstable, incoherent set of feelings, emotions and information that may be different for each person

# Problems with **maintaining** online identity
## Context collapse
Social tech. make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619234252.png]]

## People strategize to overcome context collapse!
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240619234313.png]]
rinsta: real name, posed, personal, happy
finsta: different name, people let their guard down, act silly
binsta: instagram for peoples best friends......

Think of an instance of context collapse you have experienced!

# Takeaways and Further Thought
- Marwick: the internet as "disembodied playground is a fantasy"
- Any split between "online" and "offline" identity is narrowing
- The social construction of identity has become more **self-conscious** and **visible**
- The internet and social media make identity expression **explicit** (constructed, performed, mobilized)
- Online, we experience a back and forth between **singularity** and **multiplicity**
- Internet has "**NOT** liberated people from the structural oppression of difference"
