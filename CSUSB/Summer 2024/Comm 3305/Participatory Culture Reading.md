Author first used the phrase particpatory culuture, when contrasting participation with spectatorship. 

"A participatory culture is a culture with relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagemnt, strong support for creating and sharing one's creations, and some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experiecnced is passed along to novices. A participatory culture is also one in which members believe their contributions matter, and feel some degree of social connection with one another (At the least they care what other people think about what they have created)"
