What are some examples of categories that are used to think about difference in identity?

1. Identity as Fixed or Static Ex: Professor is a CSUSB member 
    
2. Identity as Flexible and Changeable Ex: Professor is a professor, a father, a husband
    
3. Identity as Constructed Through Discourse and Social Processes Ex: Scholars and Race are socially constructed through comm, friend groups, socialization, etc 
    
4. Identity as a project Ex: Post-modern understanding, Movies and shows that we identify with, sports, ways to build our identity
    

One of the approaches to identity construction we discussed is that identity can be constructed through discourse and social processes. Some scholars argue that race (a kind of difference) is socially constructed. What are 2 observations that scholars use to make this argument?

  

- Scholars observations are through communication, media, and social processes like friend groups and schooling socialization.
    

  

Explain the concept of racialization (to racialize) and interpellation. How do these

concepts fit into the view that racial identity is socially constructed. Be able to distinguish between non-interpellation, negative interpellation and mis-interpellation. How do these contribute to the view that racial identity is socially constructed> 

- Racialize: A process in which we race others in our mind's eye, giving them a label that corresponds or contrasts with the one we give ourselves, pretty much giving people a label Ex: Look out the window, seeing an ASIAN neighbor 
    
- Interpellation: We derive our sense of identity from how we respond to the ways in which others implicitly categorize us through public speech and gestures each day Ex: We are aware of how people see us 
    
- Non-interpellation: Feeling ignored or non-existent Ex: Going to a party full of white people and being ignored essentially 
    
- Negative interpellation: Feeling uncomfortably noticed and made visible Ex: Terrorist attack that occurred in London that professor witnessed (77 Bombing) and people then looked at him with caution since he looked middle eastern 
    
- Mis-interpellation: Understanding of the self to be included in a definition of everybody and later addressed in a way that makes it clear that they are not Ex: Overhearing that everyone in the senior class will be invited to the party however you (a senior) were not invited then realizing that they didn't mean every senior 
    
- They contribute to racial identity being socially constructed by having other racial groups experience negative and unfair treatment by other racial groups. Being the odd one out essentially.
    

Explain the concept of White invisibility. How can the Jesse Williams BET speech, followed by Justin Timberlake’s tweets and the resulting backlash, demonstrate that Timberlake may have been called out for White invisibility and cultural appropriation?

- White Invisibility: Whites are reminded of their race far less frequently than others; whites have the privilege to render themselves raceless Ex: Whites can assume they are race-neutral and only those who are members of minority groups have a race Ex: Invisibility has district advantages for Whites and usually whites deny the advantages their whiteness brings 
    
- The privilege (for Whites) of White Invisibility, since some scholars assert that Whites can engage in cultural appropriation without thinking they will be criticized
    

With regard to analyzing online race, what example was used to demonstrate how racism online can operate in obvious ways? Subtle ways? Explain Nakamura’s concept of identity tourism.

  

- Obvious: Pewdiepie uses the N-word but claims he isn't racist.
    
- Subtle: GTA cover art has Mexicans in bandanas, blacks looking like a criminal and Mexicans in wife beater shirts etc.
    
- Nakamura’s concept is since most video game designers are white males, they design characters for white audience gamers to try on identities such as Cole Train from and Chun-Li and leave them behind in a superficial way. 
    

  

Be able to explain this statement: The default assumption of the Internet is non-raced

(White).

  

- Seeing who is most active in designing and building our technologies. Ex: Lack of diversity in Google/People don't use white emojis, especially white people because they don't want others to think that the “default” setting is white 
    

  

What El Pollo Loco marketing example was used to demonstrate the presence of digitally

circulated “cybertypes”. What is a “cybertype”?

- The presence of digitally circulated “cybertypes” or  “stereotypes but online” 
    

  

In the lecture, the video promo for Grand Theft Auto VI was shown. What “cyber types” from the video were noted and discussed?

- The Latina female protagonist is in trouble/criminal, African Americans are gangsters/ Hustlers, Poor white people in trailer parks, old white lady with a bat
    

  

Explain this statement: “Black Twitter” can be used to explain how race can also be a

a powerful way to organize communities.

BUT race can be a powerful way of organizing communities (both to oppress and resist/find community) Ex: BLACK TWITTER: A public group of specific Twitter users” who choose to NOT “pass” but prioritize the performance of their racial identity EX: Using #Oscarsbeingtoowhite

- This hashtag was a way to resist oppression and call out the Oscars for prioritizing white actors/actresses 
    

How did the video “Shit White Girls Say to Black Girls” demonstrate how participatory

politics can be used to invite expressions of emotional solidarity with those who are

suffering? What is a racial micro-aggression?

  

- The video can be interpreted as an effort to show emotional solidarity with Black girls who have suffered the pain of racism on a regular basis
    
- The video is one example of how online race is shaped or “created”
    
- The video can be considered an instance of participatory politics
    
- The video is a parody of the micro-aggressions that Black girls sometimes experience in the presence of some White girls
    
- Micro-Aggression: The automatic and often unconsciously uttered insults and dismissals routinely directed toward people of color (Think of South Park character PC Principal)
    
- Participatory Politics: can be used to invite expressions of emotional solidarity with those who are suffering 
    

  

How did the song about Asians in the library demonstrate how humor can be powerful

online?

- HUMOR: can be powerful, can make content spread, help us feel superior, Display unexpectedness or weirdness, Correspond to a sense of place and history, and provide release in a social tense environments
    
- He was kicked out of the school due to the backlash 
    

Be able to define sex and gender. How do they differ? How might one argue that gender

is socially constructed?

  
  
  

Explain the concept of male normativity. What is normative gender behavior in America?

How can a football player and cheerleader demonstrate these? What is non-normative

gender behavior? How do Serena Williams, Lizzo and Lil Nas X demonstrate non-

normative gender behavior?

  

With regard to sexuality, what is heteronormativity? How does the term and concept

“queer” contradict heteronormativity? Explain the article and headline, the “invention of

heterosexuality”? Explain four ways that online gender can be analyzed. What examples

did we use for each? Be able to explain the Julia Allison example (from the assigned

readers and discussed in lecture).

  

# Unit  8 

  

Explain, in your words, the concept of political economy. Is this consistent with the critical perspective?

- The perspective of political economy is an understanding of our economic system capitalism and its relationship to our political system, in our case a democracy or more specifically more precisely a representative democracy.
    
- Political economy is consistent with this critical perspective that we've been invoking in the last couple of units, that perspective that looks at power, the ability to influence people unequal amounts of power between different groups in society and social change.
    
- The critical perspective on the influence of capitalism on the Internet and on social media and why the influence of capitalism on our digital lives matters to us.
    

Some concerns that people have with social media are that it makes people lonely, our

privacy is being invaded, and that false information is rampant. How might a political

economist explain these concerns?

  

What are celebrants and skeptics of the digital revolution? Explain the Shirky example of a celebrant. Explain the Pariser and Turkle examples of a skeptic.

- Celebrants - reaffirmed that the Internet will be a force for democracy and good worldwide ending monopolies of information and centralized control over communication.
    
- Skeptics - these are people who rather than celebrate the digital revolution are skeptical of it, think that it may lead to bad things
    
- Pariser - who wrote this best selling book called the “filter bubble” how the new personalized web is changing what we read and how we think, so this was a really important book a few years ago. It showed how people generally tend to live in filter bubbles where the only information that they've been exposed to through search results and algorithms online is consistent with what we have already input and what the data or inputted views of our network connections are. In other words let's take an example if you're left in terms of politics or if you're on the right wing you tend to see stuff online that already is consistent with what you already think because the algorithms of the social media technologies are designed to show you stuff that you already that makes you angry about the other side. Its gonna show you stuff from your friend network connections, are gonna be people most often do think like you anyway, that effect is society is called the filter bubble and the idea here from Paris that's not a good thing because it means that we aren't exposed to other viewpoints other opinions about for example political issues
    
- Turkle - who wrote this book called “alone together” which is really all about the Internet paradox. The Internet paradox this idea that despite the fact that the Internet and social technologies have the ability to make us communicate with more people from more places than ever before, we actually are more alone because we were just trapped on our phone rather than communicating with more people. That's called the Internet paradox we're shunning social events again. For example, you go out to dinner with six people. Most of the people are on their phones all the time. The political economist observes skeptics' fear that the Internet is recreating people in technologies image flattening our intelligence and lessening our creativity that we are losing what was once thought of as our humanity. 
    

  

What do celebrants and skeptics of the Internet miss (what is the “elephant” in the digital

room)?

- The digital revolution, the elephant in the room, the thing that is obvious and important that nobody wants to talk about is the role of capitalism so which isn't the political economist notes that both celebrants and skeptics are ignorant about really existing capitalism and don't appreciate how capitalism dominates social life in our time. 
    

  

Why can capitalism be considered the most important factor in thinking about the digital

revolution (in other words, explain the four reasons covered in class)? What examples did we use to demonstrate these reasons?

  

With regard to the political economy of social media specifically, explain the concept of

connectivity. Explain the position of critical scholars that there has been a shift in

emphasis from users to the data users produce and how those data can be monetized.

  

What is “surveillance capitalism”? How does this concept fit into the perspective of

political economy?

  

# Unit 9

  

How did we define artificial intelligence?

- AI is the capacity of machines to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition, enabling them to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    

  

Be able to describe the theoretical perspective and position that AI are extraordinary.

- AI as extraordinary is looked at from the traditional perspective.
    
- What are the implications for our humanity? → often dystopian where humanity is going down and being overtaken by AI.
    
- At stake: who we are as humans, and what it means to be human (vs. a machine without a soul).
    
- Places our collective humanity up for grabs in ways that can elevate or destroy the human race, depending on how AI is implemented.
    
- AI seeks to re-create part of us that we have conceived as being uniquely human- our minds (this is why humanity is at stake).
    
-   
    

  

What is “at stake” from this perspective? How do utopian and dystopian narratives fit with the position that AI are extraordinary.

- At stake: who we are as humans, and what it means to be human (vs. A machine without a soul). Hence, humanity is at stake because AI seeks to re-create part of us that we have conceived as being uniquely human- our minds.
    
- Utopian → ???
    
- Dystopian → AI is trying to take over our ways of thinking.
    

  

What does AI seek to recreate, that has been conceived of as being uniquely human? How does the Ava scene from Ex Machina, viewed in lecture, demonstrate this point?

- AI seeks to recreate our mind, which has been conceived of as being uniquely human. Ava demonstrates this point because she seems to ask questions about seduction. She manipulated and killed humans to free herself and pass herself off as a human being. Hence, Ava had human intelligence to demonstrate having a mind of her own.
    

  

What was notable about the Deep Blue “win”, discussed in lecture?

- Deep Blue “win” demonstrates how AI is advanced and is able to beat the best human chess player. The AI had advanced cognition to attain this “win.”
    

  

What kinds of communication are included in the concept of “talk of AI”?

- Media representations and how scientists discuss it.
    

  

How, in terms of a metaphor, did we describe the “Mind as Machine” and “Machine as

Mind”?

- Metaphors in which the nature of the human, and the nature of the machine are being compared to make a conceptual connection between the two.
    

  

In lecture, your professor discussed how AI is often discussed in anthropomorphic terms. What does this mean – and what movie example was used to demonstrate this?

- ???
    

  

Explain the statement: AI is something of a myth!

- AI is something of a myth because the way it is displayed in media is often dystopian and hasn’t happened. It is often a story that is built. This happens in order to lead to the idea that AI is both a technological pursuit and a philosophical endeavor.
    

  

What are 4 problems with the perspective that AI are extraordinary?

1. This theoretical lens is from the mid 1900’s
    
2. metaphors connecting body & machine are clumsy
    
3. anthropomorphic portalys don’t account for differences in AI compared to human traits
    
4. focuses too much on the AI technologies of a fictional tomorrow 
    

  

Explain the position that rather than AI being extraordinary, AI are ordinary. How does communication fit into this understanding?

- AI is ordinary because it is only conceptualized and used as a type of communicator. It is used for interactions with devices and programs as a form of communication. Hence, the machine (i.e., ChatGPT, seri, etc.) becomes a communication partner.
    

  

As suggested by Guzman, what are the 4 steps or dimensions by which one can analyze AI as ordinary? What does each step or dimension involve? Be able to apply these to

analyze ChatGPT.

1. Where does the tech fit within AI as a whole? (e.g., founders, purpose, function, level of intel involved)
    
2. What are the aspects of people’s direct interactions with the AI tech. that inform their understanding of it? (e.g., interaction, interface)
    
3. Messages re: the specific tech and AI generally (e.g., culture, media, marketing)?
    
4. What are users’ own interpretations of the AI tech?
    

  

How did Mustafa Suleyman conceptualize AI in his TED talk?

  

# Unit 10 

  

What are information distortions?

- the tendency of information communicated w/in & between individuals and organizations to be altered, omitted, or re-organized as it is communicated.. includes a range of alterations from error in transmission to deliberate prevarication 
    

  

What is the difference between misinformation and disinformation? What examples of

each did we discuss?

- misinformation — the sharing of inaccurate and misleading information in an untentional way
    
- disinformation — the deliberate dissemination of false or inaccurate information in order to discredit a person or organization
    

  

How did we define a conspiracy theory? 

- an explanation of past, present, or future events or circumstances that involves a small group of powerful individuals acting in secret for their own benefit and against the common good
    

  

What examples of conspiracy theories were discussed in lecture?

- 911 → was an inside job and not terrorists
    
- Biden and Trump election → Biden stole Trump's term… Ballot fraud?
    
- JFK assassination → inside job by CIA
    
- Princess Diana → Car crash was not an accident. Wanting to get rid of her
    
- Q (anon)
    

  

How did we connect falsifiability to conspiracy theories?

- Conspiracy theories are non-falsifiable. It is difficult to refute a conspiracy theory and show that there is not one avoiding detection.
    

  

What is a deep fake? What two examples of deep fakes did we watch? Regarding the

second deep fake, what did your professor note regarding participatory politics?

- a specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped w/ another persons likeness.
    
- Examples: Mark Zuckerberg on tech taking over our minds and Prime Minister Mark Rutte on climate change
    
- Regarding the second deep fake, it is involved in participatory politics because it is making the issue known more.
    

  

What four reasons, discussed in lecture, were given in the Atlantic article, “AI is About to

Make Social Media (Much) More Toxic”?

1. Social media will wash ever-larger torrents of garbage into our public conversation
    
2. the widespread, skillful manipulation of people by AI super-influencers—including personalized influencers—rather than by ordinary people and “dumb” bots
    
3. the further integration of AI into social media is likely to be a disaster for adolescents 
    
4. AI will strengthen authoritarian regimes, just as social media ended up doing despite its initial promise as a democratizing force 
    

  

In lecture, your professor discussed 5 reasons that we should care about online

information distortion. What were they? What examples did we use to demonstrate

these? What is the “unreal”? What is the “post-truth era”? 

1. Filter bubbles & echo chambers — leads to polarization and even radicalization 
    
2. participatory culture 
    
3. reactions can move offline 
    
4. can increase distrust 
    
5. Arrival of the “unreal” and the post truth era 
    

- The unreal: an approach to politics that forsakes interpretation of a common set of facts in favor in creating closed universes of mutually reinforcing facts & interpretations
    
- post-truth era: signifies the subordination of factual or objective arguments to personal beliefs & emotion
-
