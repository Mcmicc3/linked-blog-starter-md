0:03

hey everybody uh welcome to unit three digital and participatory culture let's

0:10

start with a few announcements well first of all don't forget that office hours are on Wednesdays from 10:00 a.m.

0:15

to noon uh please do me a favor and send me a very quick email doesn't have to be anything formal just send me an email to

0:21

let me know if you will be joining so I know to look for you on Zoom so office hours Wednesday mornings 10:00 a.m. to

0:29

noon uh you have discussion response two that will be due on Thursday at 11:59 p.m.

0:39

and also you have your second progress quiz on Friday um it will be just like the first

0:45

one four true false questions four multiple choice questions open book open note you can take the quiz anytime

0:53

starting 8 a.m. you must submit by 11:59 p.m. and the progress quizzes are

0:58

not cumulative they only cover that week's content so for Progress Quiz 2

1:04

only this week's recorded lectures and designed readings or media are fair

1:12

game excuse me okay so in this unit we're going to talk a little bit about culture actually quite a bit about

1:19

culture culture at a very basic level means shared

1:26

attitudes Norms values of of a group so we have a culture on the campus

1:34

of CSUSB we have a culture in the Inland Empire we have a culture in

1:40

SoCal uh we have a culture in the US but culture doesn't only have to depend on

1:46

location culture may depend on things like sexual orientation gender political

1:52

ideology and so many more factors so whenever you identify a group that has

1:57

things in common culture points to Shared attitudes

2:02

values and Norms of that group in this course obviously our focus

2:09

is in digital media and digital platforms and so in this unit we want to think about digital culture and how to

2:17

conceptualize digital culture if we were taking this course right now in the classroom I'd stop right here and I'd

2:24

ask you what are some ways that you think we could conceptualize digital

2:29

culture and that's actually a much more difficult question than it seems because

2:34

we'd have to think through are there certain characteristics that most digital

2:40

platforms have in common in terms of the cultures there or is the culture

2:46

surrounding specific platforms so specific so identifiable only to that

2:54

platform that it's not of much use to think about conceptualizing a broader digital culture

3:00

You could argue both sides of that right so if you want to hit pause on

3:06

this recording and think about ways that you might conceptualize digital culture generally and by digital culture we mean

3:12

internet-based media and the cultures that surround them uh please feel free to do

3:18

that so today that's what we're going to focus on how to conceptualize the cultures that surround and are

3:25

facilitated by digital media and we are going to look at how Scholars over the

3:31

years and decades have made three more than three but I want to talk about three notable ones three notable

3:39

attempts to conceptualize digital culture the first is to think about the

3:44

manner in which digital media make possible more people to be empowered

3:50

than ever before because of networked culture so our first perspective we can

3:56

call Network culture or empowerment the second perspective was an attempt to

4:02

kind of wrestle with the changing media environment and that was called convergence culture and that perspective

4:09

really recognize that old mass media TV radio uh are not disappearing they're

4:17

becoming integrated into digital media so that second perspective was an attempt to kind of reconcile both you

4:24

know quote Old media unquote and quote New Media unquote and the third

4:30

perspective is the one that is more current in terms of um digital media

4:36

Scholars and the one that we'll focus more on and that is called participatory

4:41

culture which was also the focus of your reading for this unit all right let's go through each of

4:47

these three perspective which again are not the only three but three notable perspectives that Scholars of digital

4:54

media have taken to try to conceptualize digital culture the first one we can

5:00

call networked culture and empowerment okay if you are consuming uh

5:08

media let's say the most popular medium of the time in the let's say 1960s

5:13

latter part of the 1950s 1960s all the way actually through until

5:19

the you know the 90s but if you're watching TV in the 1960s this is what

5:25

consuming media look like the most popular media of course you had radio and newspapers but the most popular

5:30

medium in the 60s the TV you were sitting down and you were

5:35

passively consuming not engaging with actively but passively consuming TV

5:41

watching one of let's say three four five channels that the entire rest of

5:47

the country were watching the same channels the same scheduled content so

5:53

let's say for example there may be a sitcom or a drama and then there may be the national news followed by the local

6:00

news and then there may be some type of late night talk show or variety show the

6:05

entire nation was watching one of those three channels and the same content

6:11

passively consuming the same content that's what experiencing media look like

6:17

at the height of the mass media era the 1960s 7s and

6:23

80s of course our understanding of interacting with media engaging with

6:28

media experiencing media is so very different now and it looks more like this and so we when we're working out

6:36

we're taking a break to check out text messages to stream music to download content to tweet or we may be watching a

6:44

movie on our smartphones while also taking a break to go on to Tik Tok uh to

6:51

chat with people to check our email to send SMS messages and so on and so forth

6:58

so I know that talking about these examples is nothing Earth shattering or new we do this on a minute-by-minute

7:03

basis that's our current lies but it's worth noting that the difference between

7:09

this model of engaging with media passive consumption of the same channels

7:16

we call that the mass media era top down media where a few people in places like La New York London were deciding what

7:23

the rest of the people the masses would consume that's why it's called the mass media era it's worth overstating that

7:31

this model of media interaction or media engagement it cannot be overstated how

7:37

different it is to our current ERA of active participation with media where

7:43

each one of us if as long as we have a device or a laptop or some type of

7:49

computer and most of us do we all have the capacity to not just

7:56

engage with and consume with media but also generate and post media content

8:03

it's a completely different model so the scholar Manuel castels who

8:09

spends part of his time at the University of Southern California ask in one of his very well-known books this

8:17

question what is the main distinguishing feature of contemporary Society in other words if you were to think of one main

8:26

feature or characteristic here from a macro perspective right you were to take a step back and look at the different

8:32

eras of society what is the main distinguishing feature or aspect of our

8:38

current Society versus previous ones ones that have come before

8:44

us so if you want to pause on the recording and think of your own answer please feel free to do so but castells

8:51

in his famous book communication power provides an answer that maybe not a lot

8:56

of you would have come up with and that answer is the the network what most separates our time from previous times

9:04

is not the kind of economic system that we have or the kind of military

9:10

capability uh that for example the US has um but the answer to that question

9:16

is the presence even the dominance of the network in our

9:22

society what is a network a network is a program made of nodes which communic at

9:29

and cooperate with one another note that networks can be found

9:35

offline and online so your family for example you are a

9:40

network a program a structure of nodes which communicate and cooperate with one

9:47

another we in this class are a network each of us is a

9:52

node you might say that and if we if you visualize this and I'll show you an example of that in just one second I

9:59

would serve as a larger node in the network why because I'm the professor of the course and my responsibility is to

10:07

guide the course into interact if necessary or one necessary with each of you the department of communication

10:14

studies is a network um with uh certain faculty and

10:20

chair administrators being nodes in that Network CSUSB is a network the College

10:26

of liberal arts is a network bigger than the department of communication studies which is also a note in that Network and

10:33

so on and so forth so networks can Ur both offline and online it's just that

10:40

in our time networks the networks that we use and we are part of in our day-to-day lives whether it's our

10:46

friends dating stuff we do regarding work are increasingly found

10:53

online so again man Castell is a very well-known communication scholar communication technology studies scholar

10:59

answers the question what is it that most defines our time our society as

11:06

opposed to previous ones the answer to that question in his view is the presence and growing dominance of the

11:12

communication Network which is increasingly found online so here's

11:18

where this discussion really gets interesting if you were to accept castel's argument that the communication

11:24

network is what sets apart our time well then those entities that have that can

11:31

influence communication networks are the entities that have power in

11:38

society and that is why Castell titles this book communication power it's an

11:43

effort it's a very large book 800 or so Pages it's an effort to explain how

11:49

power Works in our current Society on the basis of who and what can influence

11:57

in some way the community communication networks that Define our time our time

12:03

being what Castell calls the network society and so here's an important

12:08

question oh before I get to that this is a visualization one example of what is called a network analysis this is a

12:14

large one with many different nodes you can see for example that ABC News is a

12:20

large node in this very big Network so some communication Scholars devote their

12:26

time to doing what is called network analysis I don't do that type of research but some

12:31

do which can trace for example the importance of how information spreads and how influence occurs in terms of a

12:39

network perspective okay so back to what we were saying just a minute

12:44

ago if you accept that the network is the most important thing or if you go with that argument in our time then the

12:51

entities that can influence communication networks are those entities that have power we can explain

12:58

how power works in our time so who and what have power in and through

13:04

communication networks in our society well let's think about that for

13:09

a couple minutes well first of all governments have power in and through

13:14

communication networks right for example one of the things when A revolution is

13:20

attempted or happens in an authoritarian country one of the first things that the

13:26

authoritarian government tries to do is to limit Li MIT access to the internet or even shut off the internet to give

13:32

you a well-known example when we had the events of the Arab Spring or Arab

13:38

Awakening many years ago now uh and you had um Revolutions in places like Egypt

13:44

the government of hos Mubarak tried to shut off the internet to stop people from being able to organize

13:51

protests or you can think of you know different countries when when a revolution bubbles up what they try to

13:57

do is to shut off the internet another example of a government exercising power in and through a communication network

14:02

is The Great firewall of China in China uh you can't search for certain things

14:09

you the search engines won't allow searches for certain terms for example

14:14

details about the massacre in tanaman square where citizens were killed by

14:19

government troops that's the abil the the attempt

14:24

and the effort to stop people from seeing certain contents online or for searching for certain content is an

14:32

example of the exertion of power in and through a communication

14:37

Network we have this uh to some degree in the US although to a lesser degree because we have more of a free market

14:44

system but for example each administration's FCC Federal

14:50

Communications uh department will take a position on the

14:56

issue of net neutrality net neutrality means the ability of people to access the internet uh at the same speeds and

15:04

for free so certain companies like internet service providers have an interest in being able to charge for for

15:11

example faster access to the internet so an Administration the FCC Federal

15:17

Communication Commission will take a position on that depending on the ideology of the administration so

15:24

governments are one type of entity that exerts power in and through

15:30

communication networks another type is the private sector for example anytime

15:36

Google makes an update to its algorithm it is exercising power when Google

15:42

prioritizes certain search results that come up when you search versus others it

15:47

is exercising power when Zuckerberg buys a new social media platform uh to limit

15:55

its ability to compete or copies it for example that is exerting

16:01

power internet service providers are another type of company that can exercise power right uh they can offer

16:09

or not for example broadband service in a rural area that's exercising

16:14

power but it's not just governments and it's not just the private corporate

16:20

sector that can exercise power in contemporary Society we can as well

16:25

users can how can we do so well we can do so by helping to frame the discourse the

16:34

communication that occurs that takes place in communication networks so we can users can activists

16:43

can build frames for example around social racial justice issues black lives

16:50

matter me too these are frames that have been built by activists and users

17:00

and spread largely through social media the internet and in framing the

17:05

communication that takes place in our Network Society our internet world that

17:11

is a kind of exercising of power and that ability at such a wide

17:18

scale is utterly unprecedented when you think about the differences between eras of media from

17:26

that passive consumption to this this active engagement that we all know so

17:32

well so one way to conceptualize the digital

17:37

Revolution uh our current time digital culture is to understand that we are

17:43

part of many networks and those entities sometimes us that can exercise power in

17:52

and through those networks is a way to understand some of these changes that have happened in our

17:57

society and in culture so that's the first perspective I was really trying to

18:03

understand the new Dynamics and capabilities associated with digital culture and with the internet

18:09

era the second perspective is called convergence culture and this was an

18:15

attempt to come to terms with how older or offline media mass media didn't just

18:22

go away they became integrated with internet based media they converged and

18:29

so this perspective was to try to understand those Dynamics and here you can see the well-known book called

18:35

convergence culture where Old and New Media Collide by uh the author of the

18:41

chapter you read for this unit uh a very excuse me prominent um scholar of

18:46

digital culture named Henry Jenkins also at USC so Henry Jenkins is a fantastic

18:54

scholar uh I say that um because he's written broadly about digital culture and the of our era but also because of

19:01

his work is very um accessible you don't have to be you know a double PhD to

19:06

understand what he's writing about he writes a lot about for example fan communities so here you can see from

19:11

Barbie to Mortal Kombat gender and computer games so he writes a lot about

19:16

pop culture and its occurrence in digital spaces and how those cultural

19:22

changes look so he's a really uh really important and interesting scholar Henry Jenkins again the author of the chapter

19:29

that you read for this unit and he starts that book convergence

19:34

culture with a little anecdote a kind of interesting anecdote that happened um in the aftermath of 911 in 20012

19:43

2002 there was a kid who a high school kid who for whatever reason decided to

19:50

start a web page you can see how kind of old old school or just basic uh web

19:56

pages looked 20 20 something years ago but he started a web page called Bert is evil where he decided to place Bert from

20:04

Burton Ernie Sesame Street in various like crazy evil situations for example

20:11

Bert as the unibomber or bur there that awful day in

20:19

1963 when JFK was assassinated in Dallas Texas there's one uh that he did uh that

20:28

supposedly put Bert into the um home sex video of Pamela Anderson which uh just

20:35

like I looked for it for a couple minutes not that I was ever going to show anything uh too risque but for

20:40

interest sake I was trying to find that one and you can't find at least from a couple of minutes digging can't find

20:45

that one on the internet but apparently there was that image of Bert as well so this high school student decided

20:51

to put Bert this TV character uh insert Photoshop Bert into images of awful

21:00

things from human

21:06

history and then it turns out that there was and again you have to think about

21:12

the context this was uh post 911 uh the US soon after that um changed

21:19

the regime invaded first Afghanistan and then a little bit later on Iraq and there was a leader or a member

21:29

of an anti-am group in Bangladesh that happened to see this

21:36

Bert is evil image when I say that I mean image from that

21:42

website and didn't recognize Bert as the character that so many

21:48

people in America know and love because although actually Sesame Street is available in that part of the

21:55

world but in a regionalized version so certain characters are there so other ones are not there but for whatever

22:02

reason chose this image of Bert inserted into a picture of 911 Mastermind Osama

22:09

Bin Laden and reproduced it and distributed it widely at

22:16

anti-america protests in that region this created of course a

22:22

worldwide outcry and really enraged the

22:27

producers of The Muppets and they in fact threaten legal

22:33

action but then again you know who are they going to sue are they going to sue this young student for posting this

22:39

image on the website they're going to track down this anti-america Zealot and uh and and

22:45

prosecute that person so this created a huge outcry uh and it's notable it's

22:52

kind of an interesting anecdote but it's notable because it demonstrates according to Henry Jenkins The Scholar

22:57

convergence culture because here you had a TV character children's character Bert

23:03

the old mass media medium that image inserted into various

23:09

evil scenarios and posted to a website New Media picked up on by someone around

23:16

the world printed into a poster an old school offline media distributed

23:22

followed by lots of backlash by mass media corporate companies covered by CN

23:28

n this is what CNN's website used to look like and it demonstrated the convergence of Old and New Media so

23:36

that's the anecdote that Jenkins begins his book

23:43

with eventually there was so much um outcry that the young student posted the

23:51

following message and took down the Bert is evil sight from his server if you

23:57

want to uh take a few seconds please to read that

24:21

text all right so let's define convergence culture or let's at least understand

24:28

some of the properties of conver convergence culture it's a culture wherein old meaning offline and New

24:36

meeing internet-based Media Collide moreover Grassroots and

24:43

corporate media intersect so the example of Grassroots media meaning media

24:49

produced by just users without a whole lot of corporate money this is an example of Grassroots media this web

24:56

page or any of your social media accounts or your web pages for example of Grassroots media Grassroots and

25:03

corporate media intersect in this slide CNN is

25:09

intersecting here the big company corporate news organization is intersecting with the Grassroots media

25:16

both this poster and the students website are examples of Grassroots

25:21

media and the power of the media producer and the power of the media

25:27

consumer in interact in unpredictable ways in fact sometimes it's not even so

25:35

easy to identify who is the producer and who is the consumer we know behaviors

25:41

like that in our time as examples of for example mixing or matching up

25:48

content but convergence culture produces a cultural shift consumers are encouraged to seek

25:56

out new information and to make connections among dispersed media

26:02

content some of those media may be online some of those be social media other media uh that are connected to

26:09

those online online media maybe TV newspaper radio and so on and so if we

26:16

look at this meme for example this is an result of convergence culture so we have the slap that

26:24

happened two years ago at the Academy Awards where uh in an in-person event

26:30

that was televised around the world but also streamed around the world on the internet we had Will Smith walking up to

26:37

slap the Comedian Chris Rock that moment immediately went viral

26:44

around the internet and in fact that moment was made into many memes this one drawing on

26:50

the old mass media format of a comic book right Batman slapping Robin and

26:58

then and the meaning inserted here to mean uh Monday slapping me or someone

27:03

trying to enjoy the weekend circulated mashed up messages changed the meme

27:09

changed widely around the internet so memes especially ones that draw upon um

27:16

old or mass media content comic books in-person events or examples or often

27:23

refer to examples of convergence culture

27:29

now we often think about convergence culture in terms of marketing or let's just say it's readily

27:36

identifiable convergence culture is when we think about certain marketing campaigns for example what are sometimes

27:43

called crossplatform or integrated campaigns and so for example the shorty

27:50

Awards is an organization that gives various Awards on an annual basis to different internet campaigns or partly

27:57

internet campaigns has a category for best integrated campaign so you can see

28:03

from this screenshot the award honors the campaign that most effectively and creatively unifies messaging across

28:11

social and traditional media channels that's an example of

28:16

convergence culture let me show you just one example and that is a campaign that

28:22

did really well the integrated campaign for the horror movie smile which I I'm

28:29

sure that some of you maybe many of you have seen this just one of many examples but one example that's pretty cool to

28:36

give you a sense or to refresh your memories of what this movie this horror movie smile is all about let's watch the

28:52

preview what is it you like to talk about I'm patient

28:59

hi I know you're nervous I just want to have a chat I'm seeing something no one else

29:05

can see except for me it's smiling at

29:11

me oh my

29:26

God yesterday a patient in your care died brutally in front of

29:31

you I need to find an explanation for what happened it's smiling at

29:38

me it's smiling at me

29:58

you're going to die you're going to die you're going to die you're going to die

30:05

I found 20 cases involving 19 victims with a direct line linking them all

30:10

together you said only 19 why is it that everybody else who's

30:17

seen it is dead and you're alive I've seen it too you get away from

30:26

me how long between each victim's death none of them survived longer than

30:31

a week today is my fourth day I am not going to keep

30:38

running I have to face it how does it make you

30:56

feel I'm just really scared that something bad is going to happen

31:07

gross all right so that is the horror movie smile um I heard I believe I read

31:14

somewhere by the way that they're uh in planning for uh smile 2 I don't know

31:19

that for a fact but I believe I saw that the other day Okay so that is the horror movie smile uh which was promoted by

31:26

this pretty orig integrated

31:32

or multiplatform marketing campaign let's

31:38

watch a description of the

31:50

campaign and tonight's fan of the game none other than the devil who is all sorts of possessed and [ __ ] up he's

31:56

just standing there

32:10

menacingly let me start it from the beginning I think that was the very end let started from the

32:19

beginning I'm seeing something anyone watching the metser Yankees on Friday may have seen something unusual behind

32:27

home PL yeah in each game there was somebody in the crowd staring really intensely into the camera smiling it's

32:34

smiling at

32:40

me you know that movie smile that's coming out did you see how Paramount was promoting it the other day without

32:46

context they would smile for nine innings straight she spent the entire baseball game like that this was for the

32:52

new film smile that's coming out I absolutely love this it is the coolest thing I think I've ever seen this is how

32:59

you can tell something is marketing gold viewers were on Twitter asking what the heck was going on that's creepy enough

33:05

to get anyone talking brilliant marketing because now we're talking about it and now people are going to

33:11

want to go see that smiling movie this weekend

33:43

and tonight's fan of the game none other than the devil who is all sorts of possessed anded up he's just standing

33:49

there menacingly

34:00

so sometimes that's called in-person or experiential marketing um of course made

34:06

into a meme um circulated widely on internet social media tick toop went viral and so on so that kind of

34:13

integrated or cross crossplatform campaign really does demonstrate

34:18

convergence culture and now let's talk about the third perspective on how to

34:26

conceptualize digital culture this one the one that you read about in fact this is the cover of the book from

34:32

which your chapter comes um the third perspective is called participatory

34:37

culture and it's really one of the most current um efforts to conceptualize

34:43

digital culture participatory culture according

34:49

to Jenkins and co-authors is a culture with low

34:55

barriers to artistic expression and Civic engagement that means that it's

35:00

not hard to express yourself artistically or to take part in Civic

35:06

engagement Civic engagement just means any type kind of online engagement that is relevant to being a

35:13

citizen matters of discussions of Taxation or voting and so

35:19

on so low barriers mean this it's not hard right you don't need to be an expert you don't have to pay huge

35:25

amounts of membership money fees to join low barriers to engagement and

35:32

expression within the community if we are to observe that participatory culture is present and it's a big

35:39

if those cultures if they are participatory will have among the

35:44

members strong support among members for creating and sharing Creations it's not

35:50

just a top down thing on social media so for example many years ago when I did my

35:56

PhD dissertation I studied how governments use social media accounts to communicate with people around the world

36:03

those spaces many of those were not participatory cultures because they were

36:10

top down in the same way that an old radio campaign may have been except just on

36:16

New Media the government agency would blast out content and would not really

36:21

listen to other members members of The public's um input the exception to that

36:27

by the way was the country of Sweden whose social media uh communities you could consider participatory there's

36:35

informal mentorship if we are to observe participatory culture informal mentorship means that somehow some way

36:43

people who are members of the communities are shown what to do the type of thing that the community

36:49

appreciates and accepts it doesn't mean there's a formal Professor or teacher or

36:55

tutor or coach who's recognizing the community but there's informal

37:01

mentorship maybe there' be some criticism or elevation when people adhere to the Norms of the community

37:08

informal mentorship when there is participatory culture members believe that their

37:14

contributions matter they don't just think that if they type something no one's ever going to look at it they

37:20

believe that their contributions matter and last if we are to observe

37:26

according to to Jenkins and other Scholars that participatory culture is present those members of those online

37:34

communities will feel social connection with each other they'll feel that there

37:40

is an important social connection with other members so these are some of the

37:45

qualities of participatory

37:52

culture and so for example this is a Reddit uh Community Reddit page

37:57

called uh nature is effing lit spelled out the effing is spelled out uh a

38:04

screenshot of which was also the title slide on this deck for this class this

38:10

kind of Reddit community may but also may not be where participatory culture

38:16

is found depending on whether there are many of these or even all of these

38:22

qualities that are present if so then these kinds of Reddit communities and

38:28

other communities in other spaces may be participatory cultures but they may also

38:34

not be depending on the qualities that are present here's a really important point

38:41

when we talk about participatory culture this kind of participation it does not just mean

38:50

being on your computer being online that is not an example of participation in

38:56

this sense participatory culture is about shared practice and shared culture it does not

39:04

just mean being longed on participatory culture describes according to Scholars a set of values

39:13

it's not the reality of current digital culture so it's not just accurate to say

39:19

we have participatory culture all around us that's not what Scholars are

39:25

arguing Scholars are argu arguing that in some digital spaces we do find

39:30

participatory culture and it is something to Aspire to it describes a set of values the most important of

39:37

which in terms of the values are diversity and democracy in interactions

39:44

what do we mean here in this specific case diversity means lots of different

39:50

kinds of people are members of the digital community and there's democracy and interactions which means that

39:58

most people feel that they have roughly the same ability to make contributions

40:04

that people pay attention to in the community to have their voice being heard so in this case the two most

40:12

important values that describe or are described by participatory culture

40:18

diversity lots of different kinds of voices in the online community and democracy which means that most people

40:25

think they have an opportunity to make their voice heard it's not one person or Voice or organization

40:32

dominating when those values are present it's a good chance that we can observe

40:38

we can conceptualize participatory culture being there so take a minute or so pause this

40:47

recording if you'd like to to think about whether or not the online spaces

40:53

that you were most frequently part of whether it is Tik Tok whether it is

40:59

Instagram uh a feed of an influencer would you describe your experiences with

41:05

particularly communities particular communities online would you describe those experiences as consistent with

41:13

participatory culture in terms of the characteristics for example informal

41:18

mentorship people who think their contributions matter do you think those values of democracy and diversity are

41:26

present in in your online community so if you want to pause and

41:31

think about that please feel free to here are some important points of

41:37

caution with regard to participatory culture before we go too far and say

41:43

that the internet is consisting everywhere of participatory culture it's not here's important points of caution

41:51

well first of all digital media are not inherently participative inherently

41:58

means in and of themselves so for example YouTube is a really important

42:04

space that offers the ability to find participatory culture but just because

42:10

you're on YouTube does not mean that you are engaging with participatory culture

42:15

it'll only be there if those characteristics and values that we've been discussing are present so here's

42:23

the bottom line with regard to digital media whether it's Tik Tok Instagram um Tumblr YouTube slack

42:32

whatever the community is they're not participatory just in and of themselves

42:39

inherently but digital media like those platforms I just mentioned they offer

42:45

the ability to find participatory cultures and communities they facilitate

42:52

the ability to have those cultures in a way that is utterly unprecedented

42:58

so that's an important distinction there social digital media can facilitate

43:04

participatory communities and culture in a way that is unprecedented greater than ever before but in and of themselves

43:11

they're not participatory there's another point of caution participatory cultures may but

43:17

also may not be oppositional or resistant to dominant ideologies

43:24

dominant World Views and so for for example this Harry Potter uh excuse me

43:30

Harry Potter Alliance which has now been rebranded uh as fandm Ford which I ask you to look at look at uh as part of

43:37

your assignment for the next unit it actually is a participatory

43:43

culture that is oppositional to dominant ideology for example the Harry Potter

43:50

Alliance now called phandom Ford at one point mobilized to do something about chocolates that were being made uh under

43:59

exploitative conditions in the developing world for example employing young young adults very young

44:06

people um to make these chocolates paying them little and maybe even in

44:12

unsafe conditions so the Harry Potter Alliance AKA Phantom Ford mobilized their online

44:21

community to advocate for Change and in fact won that Victory Wizards win so

44:26

that now uh chocolate frog sold under the Harry Potter universe or fair trade chocolates

44:34

so fandom Ford previously the Harry Potter Alliance was or is an example of

44:41

a part of a participatory culture that is resistant to corporate dominant

44:46

ideologies but nature is effing lit may just be a community that discusses and

44:54

talks about cool things in nature without talking about exploitation of

45:00

for example oil companies okay so in that case it would not be oppositional or resistant to

45:07

dominant ideologies and maybe if it did talk about you know Big Oil corporations and their oil spills well then it may be

45:14

uh it would be oppositional to dominant corporate ideologies there's another point of

45:20

caution with regard to participatory culture it did not originate with

45:26

digital media when we talk about digital media um we

45:31

often have a tendency to think that cultures that occur surrounding them or

45:37

interesting characteristics of them are utterly new and unprecedented that's often not the case arguing that it is

45:44

the case we would know as what oftentimes technological determinism and

45:49

a utopian discourse and so for example two of the subcultures and countercultures that we

45:56

focus on in my um 3102 class um media culture and

46:02

Society the punks and the hippies they can be understood as participatory

46:08

cultures if those communities meet the characteristics that we've discussed obviously those communities were present

46:15

long before the internet so participatory cultures did not originate

46:20

with digital media it's just that social digital media facilitate the

46:25

opportunity for participatory culture in a way that no other Media or type of

46:31

media has done before another point of caution um is

46:36

that new media companies are now capitalizing directly on people's participation in other words from a

46:43

critical perspective New Media conglomerates big Tech has figured out

46:48

how to make money off of participatory culture and we'll talk about that more

46:54

that more later in the course when we get to the political economy of social media uh

47:00

so like so many aspects of life and so many aspects of culture they get sucked

47:06

into the corporate machine so now big Tech has figured out how to capitalize

47:12

on participatory culture right it's a point of caution uh in terms of not thinking of participatory culture always

47:20

in utopian ways another point of caution is that participatory cultures can have

47:26

yes sometimes positive effects as in when the Harry Potter Alliance mobilized

47:31

to achieve fair trade chocolates but participatory culture can also have negative effects for example

47:40

these so-called pro-a or thinspiration websites they may well meet all the

47:47

parameters the characteristics of participatory culture this may be these communities may be participatory

47:54

cultures but obviously they are very harmful to society to young people and

47:59

especially to young women but also men young men as well and also young gender

48:05

fluid people conspiracy theory communities are

48:11

or could be another example of participatory cultures that are harmful to society why do I say harmful well

48:18

harmful because they could lead to large scale distrust of Institutions and

48:24

government and can even lead to offline violence and as has happened with Q qon

48:30

communities qon is a conspiracy theory that there's a deep states of government

48:36

operatives who are also uh satanic pedophiles who drink the blood of kids

48:42

who are conspiring to keep power for themselves and away from the one true patriot in their opinion Donald

48:50

Trump another point of caution or red flag with regard to participatory

48:56

culture or thinking about it in utopian ways is that the maintenance of status

49:03

hierarchy distinguishing between people othering people that has not gone away

49:09

just because we have digital cultures and in some cases participatory communities it's just that online people

49:17

find different ways of maintaining status of Distinction for example

49:22

through memes like this which used to be and maybe still is common on Reddit so what is this this is a meme

49:30

that people would post when they made the determination that one person speaking up was a female and then it's a

49:38

it's a it's a way to other them and to reduce what is perceived to be a female

49:43

commenter to physical attributes so in participatory cultures

49:49

in digital spaces in digital culture it's not that distinction hierarchies

49:54

have gone away they've just found new ways to

50:00

operate and so your discussion response for this week asks you to we'll first

50:06

identify one aspect of participatory culture that spoke to you but also to

50:11

address this how would you add to our understanding to this understanding that we've discussed today how would you add

50:19

to this understanding of participatory digital culture it's still a concept that is in flux that is involving what

50:26

would you add to this way this attempt to conceptualize digital culture what do

50:31

you think needs more attention in terms of this theoretical perspective that's

50:37

your discussion response for uh this week let's end this unit with some

50:43

takeaways and further thought well first of all to some critics critics of this perspective and there are critics there

50:49

are quite a few to some participatory culture as a concept as a framework can

50:55

seem to be utopian right this idea that those values of democracy and diversity

51:01

will be present to some this framework can seem utopian but remember according

51:07

to Jenkins themselves participatory culture and digital media are not in and of themselves or inherently

51:15

Democratic that's something to work to to Aspire to just because we're all you know

51:22

essentially most of us live on digital media meaning in terms of frequency that

51:28

doesn't mean that those spaces are inherently Democratic participatory culture describes a set of value

51:35

something to Aspire to and then finally the barrier to more instances of

51:43

participation participatory culture is not the technology we and most people

51:48

especially in the developed word world have access to the Technologies the vast

51:54

majority of people in America and other West countries have for example

52:00

Broadband but or in other words the Broadband is available te the technology

52:05

is available but the barrier is privileged not

52:11

everybody has the time or the skills or sometimes the resources to it to be able

52:16

to use them and so I I let me clear this last point up a little bit we have the

52:22

Technologies for many communities most communities to engage in participatory

52:28

culture we have the technology it is available but the barrier is privileged

52:33

not everybody has the time people working two three jobs are not going to have much time some PE sometimes people

52:40

don't have the literacy the skills to engage in digital media the way some

52:45

other people do and some people even in developed country developed countries like ours don't have the

52:51

resources Broadband is still not available in some rural areas some people don't aren't able to afford a

52:58

smartphone so the barrier to more participatory culture is not the technology the technolog is available

53:04

but the barrier is privilege and that will end unit three thank you very much for listening and for watching
