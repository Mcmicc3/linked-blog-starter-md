1960s

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612215123.png]]
- Passively consuming TV watching 1 of 3 channels
- This is what consuming media was like in the 60s
- It's changed since then
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612215217.png]]
- The difference is that we actively participate in media now

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612215327.png]]
- If we are to look at different eras
- What defines out era and makes it different from everyone elses
- author argues it's the network
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612215405.png]]
- Networks can be online and offline
- Computers, people
- Presence and growning communication network that defines our time
- It is these networks that give us power
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612220438.png]]
Governments have power in communication networks. Governments try to remove peoples connection to the internet, so they can't search for certain terms, or organize a riot. 
- In the US, we have issues with net neutrality.

Limiting services is excersizing powers
- Governements, cooprerations and users limit power

People frame the discourse happening in networks
- BLM...Me too....This is how we exercise power
- That's what makes us widely different than people in the 60s who just watched tv

We are part of many networks.

2nd perspective.
Mass media didn't go away, it integrated with internet media.

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612220935.png]]
Some kid started a web page called bert is evil, and placed him in crazy situations
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612221001.png]]
There was one where he put hiimself in the phone sex video of Pamela Anderson, 
Someone put bert in an osama bin laden picture
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612221259.png]]
- Anecodote for old and new media
- So much outcry that he took the website down
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612221357.png]]

Convergence culture
- Old and new media collide
- Grassroots and corporate media intersect
- power of media producer and power of media consumer interect in unpredictable ways

- Convergence culture. Something that happened in real life, and then made into many memes

Now we think of convergence as marketing, or **integrated campaign**
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612221623.png]]
- Convergence culture
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612221640.png]]

Marketing
- Tiktok made the promotion viral and into a meme
- Experiencial marketing

3rd perspective, participatory culture

A culture within
- Low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement
- Strong support for creating/sharing creations
- Informal mentorship
- members who believe their contributions matter
- members who feel social connection with each other

nature is f'ing lit 

- May or not be parcipatory culture based on things that are or aren't present

Participation does not just mean being active online: it's about SHARED practice and culture

Describes a set of values, NOT the reality of current culture

Most IMPT values: diversity and democracy in interactions

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612222420.png]]

Caution:
Digital media are not inherently participatory
- Youtube, slack, tictalk, are not inherently participiatory
- Can facilitate

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612222625.png]]

participatory cultures may or may not be oppositional/resistant

- They can be understood as participatory culture if they meet the requirements. Technology did not create this type of culture

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612222916.png]]
- big tech has figured out how to make money off of participatory culture
- Can have negative effects
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612222928.png]]
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240612222939.png]]
- Conspiracy theory (brought up blood drinking and trump lol)
- People doing unhealthy things to stay thin

Takeaways and further thought
- To some crirtics, particiaptry culture acn be utopian
- but remember, p.c. and digital media are not inherenlty democratic
- participation is something to aspire to
- the barrier to participation is not the technology, but privilege (e.g. time, skills, resources)
