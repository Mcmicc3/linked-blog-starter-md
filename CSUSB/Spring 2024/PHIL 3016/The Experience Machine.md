Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your life's experiences? If you are worried about missing out on desirable experiences, we can suppose that business enterprises have researched thoroughly the lives of many others.
- Pick and choose from other peoples experiences. 
- Select your experiences for two years at a time,
- Get out of the tank and pick out your next two years. 

Objections. We want to *do* certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them. 
- Why do we want to do the activities rather than merely to experience them?

Second reason, we want to *be* a certain way, to be a certain sort of person. 
The person in the tank is merely a blob, neither courages, kind, intelligent.
- Should it be surprising that what *we are* is important to us? Why should we be concerneed only with how our time is filled, but not with what we are?

Third reason, we're limiting ourselves to a man-made reality, to a world no deeper or more important than that which people can construct. 
Some view drugs as a mere local experience machine, and others view drugs as avenues to a deeper reality. 

There is *something that matters to us in addition to experience* by imagining an experience machine and then realizing that we would not use it. 
- The machine doesn't meet our desire *to be* a certain way
What about a transformation machine? 
- You would transform into what you want, and then plug into the experience machine
There is something in addition to what *one is like* **and** what one experiences. 
- But these two things are not mutually exclusive? 

What about the result machine?
- What if you're someone who wants to make a difference in the world?

# Example
Being handed an unplugged Nintendo 64 controller when I'm 5, and being told by my cousins that I'm killing it in Donkey Kong Country, when I know damn well I'm not. 

1. _The big picture/summary_
The big picture the author wants to convey in his paper, is that people would prefer not to have man made, unearned, good experiences, because we have a desire **to be** the actual things we want in life in addition to good experiences. 

2. _Analysis/key ideas_
The first argument the author makes for this idea is when he suggests that people, "*want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them or thinking we've done them.*". People want the satisfaction of actually becoming the type of person they want to be, by being capable of doing the actions necessary to achieve a positive experience. If someone were to plug themselves into an experience machine, they would be nothing, like an object. They would have no positive or negative qualities to them because all their experiences are happening within their minds, and that's not a state of being that people want to be.

Another argument the author makes is that we would be limiting ourselves to man made experiences, where there's no possibility of achieving anything more than what the machine can produce for you.

3. _Critical engagement/do you agree or disagree and why?_
I agree with the authors arguments for the most part, and I thought it was interesting when he made the connection to drugs and the experience machine, like it's peoples personal experience machine, and it can be similar to drugs, where we see a person, but they're not with us because the experience is happening in their heads. 

4. _Discussion question_
