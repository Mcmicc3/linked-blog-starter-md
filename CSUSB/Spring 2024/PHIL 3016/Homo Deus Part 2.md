Humanism is the relgiious belief that will ultimately lead us to new projects and undermine humanism with different reglisions, beliefe systems, and humans and their place int eh univcerse.

The second slection is about the second project that humans will take on as a species, "lasting happiness"

#### Homo Deus on Happiness
"People believe that the immense programs made to strengthen the system (retirement, pensiosn), They should actually serve the happiness and well being of people." They're not here to serve the state, they're here to serve us.

Aristotle stands that, happiness is the best end. 

We do things to strive to be happier (go to starbucks, ,meditate, etx). The right to pursiut to happiness, has morphed into the *right* to happiness. Natual human right to be happy. Anything agaisnt it should be a violation.

We have a *right* to be happy. Happiness is a personal and important meaning for all of us. We think our relationships, schools, therapsists, doctors, everything should make us happy. 

### How can we improve happiness, or help with a lack of happiness?

War, faminine, and disease are technical problems. After solving these problems, happiness should be easy right? Is it true? Are people in wealthy communities happier than others? Doesn't seem to be the case. 

It doesn't seem like even if we solve all the worlds problems, we would all be happy, *Glass Ceiling*. Acheiving real happiness should be easier than solving death.

Our happiness sets our expectations for our wants in the world. The *Hedonic Treadmill*. We seek pleasure. Each bite of ice cream doesn't hit the same as the first bite. Other things in life, we chase that dragon, constantly wanting more. 

There is a biological limit in our biochemistry that allows happiness. 

Author thinks we're going to rig the system to rig happiness
- Drugs (anti depressants, anti anxiety). Acheiving happiness through pharmecuticals
- Also illegal drugs (MDMA, Ecstasy, weed)
- Brain interface technology (identify parts of the brain, feel good emotions)
- Genetic Engineering (Find the genes responsible for mental illness). CRISPER technology to design embryos
- Religion

Of all these options, which will get the most funding and interest for research (in a captialist economy)
- DRUGS
- Genetic Engineering

At present, HUmans have more interest in the biochemical limit. We know how to get off the hedonic treadmill (start meditating, scale back wants).  We try to fix boredom and discomfort (music, our phones, apps). 


# Reading Notes
Scepticism about the afterlife drives humankind to seek not only immortality, but also earthly happiness. Who wants to live in eternal misery?
During the tentieth century, Countries measured their success by the size of their territory, the increase in their population, and the growth of their GDP -- not by the happiness of their citizens. 
Systems built that were aimed towards strengthening the nation, rather than ensure individual well-being(2)

You fought for your country at 18, paid taxes at 40, because you counted on the state to take care of you when you were seventy. The founding fathers declared *the pursuit* of happiness as one of three unalienable human rights.  (3)

The right to the puisuit of happiness, orginally envisaged as a restraint on state power, has imperceptibly morphed into the right to happiness - as if anything which makes us dissatisifed is a violation of our basic human rights, so the state should do something about it. 
Production is important because it proves the material basis for happiness. But it is only the means, not the end. GDP vs GDH (Gross domestic happiness). if humankind expereineces unprecedented peace and propserity, and if life expectancy increases dramatically, humans still won't be happy.
Epicurus defines happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is hard work to be happy. He outlined an entire ethic of dos and don'ts to guide people along the treatherous path to happiness (4)

In developing countries suffering from poverty and polotical instability, 1 in 100,000 commit suicide. In rich countries, twenty-five per 100,000 commit suicide. Despite South Koreans success in becoming a leading economic power, the suicide rate has tripled in size. 
In the stone age, the average human had at his or her disposal roughly about 4,000 calories of energy per day. Today, Americans on average use 228,000 calories of energy per person per day. Today, on average, we use sixty times more energy than the average stone age hunter-gatherer, but we're not sixty times happier. (5)

It only took a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer? After all these amazing advancements in the US from the 1950s to the 2000's (Increase GDP, Minority power, technology advancements, quality of life advancements), studies have shown that American subjective well-being levels in teh 1990s remained roughly the same as they were in the 1950s.
As if our happiness bangs agaisnt some mysterious glass ceiling that does not allow it to grow despite all our unpreceedented accomsplishments. 
Glass ceiling of happiness is held by two pillars, **one psychological, and the other biological**.  psycho, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. As conditions improve, expectations balloon. Imrpovements in the human condition, translate to greater expectations. (6)

On the otherhand, happiness is determined by our biochemistry, rather than our economic, social, or political situation. Jeremy Bentham, two dominions over man, pleasure and pain. Happiness is nothing but pleasure and freedom from pain. Beyond pleasure and pain, there is no good or evil. According to life science, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations. **We only react to sensations within our own body**. (7)

Things that happen outside of our bodies don't always dictate how we feel inside. We could get a promotion and not feel anything inside, or we could get fired and not feel anything. 
After getting promoted or winning the world cup, the feeling goes away after hours. We'd have to keep getting promotions, and if we don't we may feel bitter and angry. **This is the fault of evolution**. (8)

Say there was a squirrel who enjoyed eternal bliss after eating a single note a million years ago, there would have been a very happy squirrel that lived a very short life, and it's genes would have been gone. That squirrel wouldn't have gone looking for nuts or mates. Rival hungry squirrels had a better chance of passing their genes. We're the same with lucrative jobs, big houses and good looking partners. 
Some say it's not the goal, it's the journey, like climbing everest. This still proves that eveolution controls us with a broad range of pleasures. When we seek pleasure, our brain produces sensations of alertness and excitment. (9)

Famous experiment of rats brains being connected to a pedal that gives them pleasure, and they kept pressing it until they died of hunger or exhaustion. What makes the race so attractive is the exhiliarating sensations that go along with the race. Perhaps the key to happiness is neither the race nor the gold medal, but rather combining the right doses of excitment and tranquillity
**If science is right and our happiness is determined by our biochemical systen, tehn the only way to ensure lasting contentment is by rigging this system**. We need to manipulate human biochemsitry. We've been doing this the past few decades with pyschiatric drugs. Increasing numbers of schoolchildren take stimulants (10)

3.5 million kids take ADHD medicine. For thousands of years, throughout different cultures, everybody still agreed on one thing: in order to improve education, we need to change the schools. Today, for the first time in history, at least some people think it would be more efficeient to change the pupuls biochemistry. 
Growing percentages of soldieres taking pills for sleeping or antidepressants. Fear is not caused by external sources, it is caused by hormones, neurotransmitters and neural networks. Two soldiers may experience the same traumatic event, one will be plauged with PTSD, the other will charge and win medals. The difference is in their biochemistry, **and if we find ways to control it, we'll make everyone happier soldiers and more efficient armies.**
The pursuit of happiness through biochemicals is the number one cause of **crime in the world**. Large percentage of inmates are in for drugs. (11)

*What some people hope to gegt by studying, working or raising a family, others try to obtain far more easily through the right dosage of molecules.* Countries wage war on drugs because it as an existential threat to the social and economic order. The state wants to regulate the biochemical puruist of happiness, separating bad manipulations from good ones. *Biochemcical manipulatiosn that strengthen political stabilitym social order, and economic growth are allowed and even encouraged* (ADHD medicine for kids, antidpressants for soldiers.) New drugs come out every year, making it harder to control. Electrical signals being sent to the brain. No matter the exact method, gaining happiness through biological manipulation won't be easu, for it requires **altering the fundamental patterns of life**. (12)

Budhha taught that the puisuit of pleasant sensations is i nfact the very root of suffering. *Pleasure quickly disappears, past memories do not satisfy.* The more you crave pleasant sensations, the more stressed and dissatisfied you become. To attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pelasant sensations, not accelerate it. 
Buddhas teachings and biochemicals are solutions both recognize crazing pleasant sensations but handle them different. Biochemicals introduce an uneding stream of pleasant sensations. Buddha suggests to reduce our cravings for plesant sensations and not allow them to control our lives (13)

Both scientific research and economic activity are geared to the end for pleasant sensations, each year producing better painkillers, ice-cream flavors, better mattresses.(14)

Everything that happens in the cosmos is judged to be good or bad according to its impact on humans. humanists worship humans. 

With the help of vaccinations, medications, hormones, pesticides, central air-conditioning systme , and automatic feeders, it is now possible to pack tens of thousnads of pigs, cows, or chickens into neat rows of cramped cages, and produce meat, milk and egg with unpreceendented efficiency. Couldn't do that in the days of peasants. (16)

In practice, American lives are more valued. Far more moeny is invested in the education, health and safety of the average American than of the average Afghan. Killing an American makes a far greater international outcry than an afghan. What is the unique **human spark** the gives us moral justification for our privileged status? (18)

The traditional answer is that humans have souls and animals do not. 
True, science still has not been able to prove the animals have a soul. Alas, the same laboratory experiments undermine the second and far more importatnt part of the monotheist myth, namely, that humans *do* have souls. Thousands of bizarre experiments and looked into every nook in our hearts and every cranny in our brains, and still, no magical spark. Zero evidence to support that humans have souls. life sciences doubt the existence of souls because it contradicts the most funamental principles of evolution. (19)

People with and without degrees have varying opinions if humans came to be naturally through evolution, if we came through god, or if god orchestrated our natural selection. We go up in arms over the theory of evolution, but not over the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, where we can twist time and space, or things can appear out of nothing. We ahve no problem teaching things that contradict our common sense. (20)

# **I don't understand this argument**
*If you really undersatnd the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul.*? 
Author describes it as theist want to believe that each human possesses an eternal individual essence that remains unchanged throughout life, and can survive even death intact. 
According to evoltion, all biological entities - from elephants and oak trees to cells and DNA molecules - are composed of smaller and simpler parts that ceaselessly combine and separate. (21)

Talks about evolution and how everything in our bodies come from mutations that happened millions of years ago. Asks the question of **At what point did we get souls?** Did our souls develop over time? *Is there some part of the soul that is more developed in Sapiens than in Erectus?* (22)

We experience pain and discomfort like hunger, and that's what makes us conscious, not like robots who when their batteries are low experience nothing. People in Rene Descartes days, believed that animals were mindless automata, and treat them like robots (24)

We don't fully understand consciousness and the human brain (25)

*Scientists don't know how a collection of electric brain signals creates subjective experiences. Even more crucially, they don't know what could be the evolutionary benefit of such a phenomenon.* Why do humans have subjective expereiences of hunger and fear? Why do electrical signals stemming from our eyes, travel to our legs to run away in fear from lions, and why add subjective thought to the mix? (28)

Random thoughts like homer drinkning a beer, thinking of Bill Clinton, these thoughts/ neural links and networks happen in the *global workspace*, created by the interaction of many neurons.  (29 or 30)

People don't use God to explain life anymore (rainfall, lightening, economic crisis). Author claims the same fate is true for our souls, we don't use God to explain our souls. Intelligent people who still believe in souls never write about them in serious scientific journals. Maybe the mind should join the soul? God and ether in the dustbin of science? (33)

Author took an evil act and broke it down as electrical signals traveling from one side of the brain to the other. What's wrong witht hat? (34)

Freudian argument: militiary takes in young men when their sex drive is at its hightest, then they refuse to allow them to have sex. This turns into military aggression. Exactly how a steam engine works. (35)

How can we distinguish human consciousness and a series of compelx algorightms in a computer? 
Already thousands of years ago philosphers realised that there is no way to prove conclusively that anyone other than oneself has a mind. (36)

As of now, we have the turing test, to suggest whether a computer is conscious or not, but it won't really be a proof of course. Achnolowding the existeence of other minds is merely a social and legal convetion. **We don't know how to measure consciousness**. (37)

*If humans had not learned to coorperate flexibly in large numbers, our crafter brains and deft hands would still be spliutting flint stones rather than uranium atoms.*. Our cooporation is flexible. Some animals cooperate in small numbers of friends and family members that they personally know to be good, or not evil. Humans on the other hand constantly cooporate with countless numbers of strangers. This capabilit rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness - explains our mastery of planet earth. (40)

It is risky to extrapolate from small-group behaviour to the dunamics of mass societites. A nation of 100 million people functions in a fundamentally different way to a band of hundred individuals. (42)

We refuse unfair offers because people who meekly accepted unfair offers didn't survive in the Stone Age.

Scientific experiment of feeding two chimps a cucumber for handing a stone. The first monkey completes the task again and gets a grape, the second chimp gets a cucumber. He becomes enraged. *He aint a sucker*. Primates have a natural morality, and that equality is a universal and timeless value. People are egalitarian by nature, and unueqal societies can never function well due to resentment and dissatisifcation. (44)

Sapiens often use visual marks such as a turban, a beard or a business suit to signal, 'you can trryst me, I believe in the same story as you'. Our chimpanzee cousins cannot invent and spread such stories, which is why they cannot cooperate n large numbers.

People find it difficult to understand the idea of 'imagined orders' because they assume that tehre are only two types of realities: **objective realities and subjective realities.** Objective being gravity, things that exist independentatly if we believe in them or exist in our minds. Subjective reality relies on my beliefs and feelings. (46)

People don't believe in a third option. God, money and nations must therefore be objective realities (they exist outside of me). There is a third level of reality: **the intersubjective level**. These entities depend on communication among many humans rather than on the beliefs and feelings of individual humans. It's a large amount of people who agree on the same thing that gives money its value. (47)

The same can happen to laws, gods and even entire empires. The fall of the soviet union, Greek gods, all cease to exist. People don't want to accept that *our* god, *our* nation, or *our* values are mere fictions, because these are the things that give meaning to our lives. We want to believe our lives have meaning, yet the truth in the lives of most people have meaning only within the network of stories they tell one another. (48)

*Meaning is created when many people weave together a common network of stories.* Actions like getting married in church, ramadon or voting. Why does everyone we know think all this stuff is meaningful? (49)

Author talks about a young crusaider, believing that if he gets killed by a Muslim he'll go to heaven. Tells us to think of a church in those days saying if we killed muslims, god would welcome us to heaven. Then one day, someone announces that the Muslims destroyed the crusader army at Hattin. (50)

The pope then promises eternal salvation for everyone who fought to reclaim Jerusalem. People praising each other for volunterring to fight. As they travel through different countries, they get joined by other bands of the same religion, helping to fight the same cause. They come to find that the Muslims were told the same thing. (51)

Describes meaning as something that changes over time, All those buildings crumbled, there's now people in greece cutting open humans, expanding science. Mentions Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Mentions John Lennons "*Imagine if there was no heaven*". Today if someone in England were to help the Syrian refugees, the middle age people would have thought he had gone insane. (52)

*Sapiens rule the world because only they can weave an intersubjective web of meaning*: a web of laws, forces, entities and places that exist purely in their common imagination. This allows us to organize crusades, socialist revolutions, and human rights movements. Animals are confined into the objective realm (cats thinking of mouses, i.e things that actually exist in the real world, unlike communism, taxes, or the EU). (53)

The author talks about the christrians and reclaiming Jersualem like wolves trying to appropriate the territory of a neighbouring pack. *Maybe someday breakthroughs in neurobiology will enable us to explain communism and the crusades in strictly biochemical*
