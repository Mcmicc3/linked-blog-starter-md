For as long as humanity has existed. Our biggest concerns have been: Famine, diseases, and war. 

In the past 300 years, we have made huge acheivements towards solving these problems. Turned them from innevtiable facts, into technical problems. We still ahve these problems, btu we've gained enough knowledge and acheived enough, that we don't think of these problems as inevitable.
- We don't say it's gods plan
- We say someone fucked up, or this dictator is a maniac. 
We think of war as a problem that someone goofed up.

Same thing with disease. 
- Covid: We studied it, and treated it as a technical problem

##### As these problems decrease, which new problems will we try to solve?
Author thinks there's three new things humanity will strive for
- Defeating death and old age
- Achieving happiness
- Upgrading humans into demi gods, or super humans

How do we know this is the new agenda? If we look at where we spend money
- Defeating strokes, alheizerhmers, diabeities
We're working on defeating death to acheive an old age

Acheiving happiness? 
- Counselors, therapists
- Lots of research in overcoming tramua
- Pharamecutical interventions, medication for people suffering anxiety or grief
Upgrading human beings?
- We're devloping biotic limbs
- Devleoping helmets to read brain signals, or pass on signals to your brain
- Plastic surgery, lipsuction
- **We're already upgrading ourselfves**

For these reasons, it looks like we're going to continue pursuing these goals

## Liberal Humanism
"These problems are obvious concerns given the dominant 'religion' of the last few centuries **Liberal Humanism**"

Religion: "A set of beliefs that give our lives order and meaning".
Religion is a set of beliefs that guide our ethics.

Humanist beliefs: Human lives are unique and special. We have deep authentic selves that we should live up to

Liberal: Agnostic about what the good life is for other people. You can recognize that there's lots of other unique good lives. We should respect the diversity of people. We should make space for all the different people to live their good life, as long as it doesn't infringe on others.

Social humanism?
evolutionary humanism?
- Best life for humans is found on competition. 
- Nazism. 

Liberal humanism is the domaint relaigion of the last 300 hundred years. Doesn't mean that we can't practice another reigious belief. However, world wide, cultural liberalism is the most popualr set of beliefs around the world. We probably believer that human life is special and sacred, and we occupy a sacred plave in the world

We probably believe in all five of these.

How do these connect to the new agenda?
![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222153533.png]]

**New religions might come: Techno-Humanism and dataism**

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222153738.png]]

Why can't we stop?
- We're not going to stop buying bionic limbs, because we're worried about how other people will upgrade themselves
- Research is happening all around the world
- Even if one nation made laws to restrict the research, that doesn't stop other nations from doing it

If we did stop, That would lead to economic collapse
- A lot of innovation and economic growth would halt

Even if we wanted to beat death, simply pursing that, will lead to super humans
- No clear line between healing and upgrading
- What if we can do genetic testing and check embryos
- What if we can opt to make our child smarter? Or opt to never be depressed? Or beautiful?
- **Would you do it?**** It's hard to say.
Because of these reasons, we won't hit the brakes

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222154311.png]]

We haven't solved death, happiness, or super humans yet.

In the pursuit of that, we will find problems.
Especially for things that regard changing minds
**Chinese schools** adopted these bands that you see the kids above wearing, and it reports real time data to teachers and parents about how attentive a student was.
- Some will think this is good: Teachers can see when students lose focus, could help create better education
- Some will think this is bad: We are creating a generation of kids who think it is normal to have their mind read. People who succeed with the headbands will be seen as good, ideal students. Good brain waves will be seen as a winner. 
	- Wouldn't the people who are successful with these bands, want the technology to develop further?

##### Quick note about the death of God
Talks about the rise and fall of many religions
- Egyptions and their pherohs. 
- Middle ages, if you told people god was dead, life would have no meaning.
God is the explanation for life
- Why did you not succeed in life?
- How do you choose to marry?
- Why did these countries go to war?
- God

He's not saying god is dead, he's saying that God is not the main idea for all our decisions.
We don't turn to God anymore for when crops fail or if we're looking for someone to marry
- Dating apps
- Changes in agriculture
We no longer consult god or church in the same way that we use to.

He argues that both deaths were positive, and it may be a good thing now, but who knows.....

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222162619.png]]

Humans treat animals poorly
- Farms, crates, sent to the butcher, fry and eat them
- Cook their babies, wear their skin![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222163428.png]]

Will superhumans/AI, be superior to humans? 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222163315.png]]

What is the reason why we think humans are different or superior to animals?

What if we got into DNA editing, and created super humans, should they feel superior to super humans?

The only thing left that makes humans more special than animals is that maybe we're sacred?
- Self consciousness
- Have a soul?
- Free will? 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222164048.png]]

Our brains, are just algorithms
- Neurons firing away
- Things happen, and we can explain things like organic machines
- Maybe we aren't special

Since we're special and sacred, death is a crime against us
- We ahve the right to life, happiness

As we tackle these problems, we discover that humanity may not be that special. 

![[Trash/SYNC/Images/Pasted image 20240222165402.png]]

Death is an attack on the sacredness of humanity.

We know that death is a technical problem.
- Technical problems have technical solutions

Mortals are anxious about taking risks

Lets say we live to 150
- How would that change politics, our careers, education?
- How would this effect marriage and relationships?
- Are supposed to stay married for the next 130 years?



# Thoughts
Image the hellish landscape of going to grade school with "beautiful smart people", simply because their parents had more money than yours. The superiority complex they would have. And what if they're in a position where they can continue to live and stay beautiful longer than you, because they have money, and you begin to feel hopeless because you won't have that money until later in life if ever. 

# Writing
1. The main point that author makes in his book, is that because of humanities evolutionary needs, as well as the economies need for innovation and growth to maintain a stable society, we will evolve ourselves into a society that will focus it's attention into solving the problem of becoming immortal, happy, and super humans/demi gods.
2. a. One of the main points the author uses to make his point, is that universally, humans believe we are sacred, and that fundamentally we have the right to life.  Death in itself is a violation to this right, and there is no limit. It's not, the right to just 90 years, it's the right to *life*, period. The reason this point is so impactful, is that he uses this argument to logically explain why we can expect humanity will always try and innovate new ways to push this biological boundary.
   b. One logical argument that he uses to explain why humans are interested in modifying their bodies, and potentially becoming super humans/ demi gods in the future, is that we're seeing it happening today with ordinary healthy people. The first example he gave was for plastic surgery, it was discovered to help repair damaged facial tissues for war veterans in WW1, now we're using the same technology for people who want prettier noses. Another example was healthy people using Viagra, so they can have a temporary sexual advantage compared to healthy people who don't use them. 

3.Â  I did find the authors argument to be convincing. He makes a lot of bold statements in his paper, but he explains his arguments logically, and not in a prophecy type of way. I would agree the best way to logically approach where humanity is heading in the next 50 to 100 years, is to examine human behavior in regards to how we view current problems, and what we've done in the past to solve past problems. His strongest argument to me, is that the point is not whether or not humanity will **succeed** in achieving these technological advancements, its that humanity will never stop *trying* to achieve these advancements - even if it kills us.

4.   If society reached a point where we could genetically alter our DNA to have desirable traits, or possibly recreate someone with talented skills, for example, someone like Antoni Gaudi, a famous spaniard known for his gift in creative architecture, should someone like that have a copyright to their DNA? Even if society decided they wanted new buildings, should someone like that have the right to their DNA? As of right now, is our DNA open and available to the public? 

# Reading Notes

One central project for humanity will be to protect humankind and the planet. Our ability to solve famine, plague and war has also brought new problems. The same growth in technology to solve famine has destabilized the ecological equilibrium of the planet in ways we've only yet began to explore.  People always choose growth rather than ecological stability.(6)

Humans are rarely satisfied with what they already have. Humanitities next targets are immortatility, happiness, and divinity. "The right to life" is humanitites most fundamental value. Death is a crime against humanity because it violates this right. (7)

"Because Christianity, Islam and Hinduism insisted that the
meaning of our existence depended on our fate in the afterlife,
they viewed death as a vital and positive part of the world." 
God gives death meaning. Death in the modern world is not a metaphysical mystery, it is a technical problem. Death can be explained by technical reasons, and the causes can be explained technically aswell. Death is no longer metaphsycial (8)

Presently, we don't have all the answers to all technical problems, which is why we invest so much time and money in researching cancer, germs, genetics, and nanotechnology. (9)

Death from Hurricanes, car accidents, and ware are technical failures that could ahve been avoided. The universal law is that life is a human right, not a human right until 90. If we cure cancer and tuberclusios, it's not like we'll stop there and continue letting people die from alheizmers. The right to life is not limited by any expiry date. Big names like Google Calico, Ray Kurzweil, and Bill Maris are pushing for immortality through technology. (10)

Peter theil, cofounder of Sillicon Valley Luminaries is influential, and invests 2.2 billion on the mission to fight death and live forever. They believe anyone with a healthy body and bank account by 2050 will live forever. They will still be mortal, because an accident may still happen, which would make them the most anxious people alive (11)

Marriages will be long. Imagine having kids at 40, when you're 110, it would be a distant memory. In careers, because of how fast technology advances, you would have to reinvent yourself over and over again. People wouldn't retire. The phrase "Science advances one funeral at a time", would get messed up. There wouldn't be space for new ideas. (12)

Imagine having a boss now that was 120. Would you want to take directions from someone who was born in the victorian era today? Think of political leaders still being in charge for another 70 years. It wasn't strange for previous generations to have people live into their 90s. Modern medicine saves people from premature death, but it hasn't extended a normal life by more than one year, let alone 500. (13).

"Hence even if we don't achieve immortality in our lifetime, the war against death is still likely to be the flagship project of the coming centurary.". Can you think of a more exciting scientific challenge than outsmarting death? Can you imagine how someone in their 40's with money, would pay to have their 25 year old body back? (14).

People don't care about eternal glory as much as they think they would. They want immortality. If it happened, it would go from the labratories, to parliaments, courhouses, and then the streets. Once this happens, it will trigger bitter political conflicts. All the wars and conflicts of history might turn out to be but a pale prelude for the real struggle ahead of us: eternal youth. (15).

If there were superhumans, we'd feel like old people who can't contribute to society anymore, our problems and throughs would be irrevelant, like a neanderthal on Wall Street. Our world of meaning would collapse.  (16)

The internet has advanced so much in the past 25 years, think of what the next 25 years would look like. Insurance companies, pension funds, health systems and finance ministries are already aghast at the jump of life expectancy. There is not enough money to pay for their pensions and medical treatment. (17)

Experts are calling to raise the retirement age, and restructure the entire job market. We're reaching towards the great unknown, and we can't count on death to shield them from it. 
We can't hit the brakes. No single person can fathom how a large discovery in AI could impact nanotechnology, noone can fathom what the global economy will look like in 10 years. Since noone understands the system any more, no one can stop it. If we did stop, the economy will collapse, along with society. The modern economy needs constant growth to survive. The same technology that's used to help sick people in upgrading humans, can be used to upgrade healthy humans. If we enhance the memory of old people, we can do the same for young people. (18)

Example of Viagra being used by healthy people to gain an advantage. Plastic surgery was discovered in WW1 when it was used to help wounded veterans, they then found that same surgery can help people make their nose more beautiful. Its devoted a lot of attention today in upgrading healthy people into being more beautiful, the healthy and wealthy. If a
billionaire openly stated that he intended to engineer super-smart offspring, imagine the public outcry. Social engineering would begin by helping a child with a high risk of a deadly genetic disease, they will perform "in vitro" fertilization. If it works, why stop at just 1 egg? better fertilise several so there is atleast one good embryo. (19)

Why not rig the lottery of the type of child you can have, beauty and brains. One possible method for creating super humans. Stem cells lead to an endless supply of human embryos, and we can select our baby from hundreds of candidates, all carrying our DNA, all natural, without requiring any genetic engineering. What if we make embryos with deadly mutations? Then the next breakthrough would involve replacing the problematic genes. A baby in 2000 has already been born with genetically altered DNA. The mitochondria came from another woman, and she technically has three parents. It was banned in US, but voted in favour in the UK, "Three-parent embyro law". (20)

Next step is amendment. Why go through the hassle of replacing bad DNA genes, when you can just rewrite the code and turn a dangerous mutant gene into its benign version. Then we would move from deadly genes to less dangerous ones like autism, stupidity, and obesity. If you knew you could save your daughter from chronic depression, wouldn't you save her from years of misery by a quick and painless intervention in the test tube? Slippery slope from here, better immune system, better memory. What if the neighbor does it for theirs? Would you let you child lag behind? Even if our government bans it. what stops North Korea from doing it? **Healing is the initial justification for every upgrade**. If we cure cancer, schizophrenia through technology, it will not stop there. (21)

Eugenics fell out of favor after the second world war. Organ harvesting is illegal, but very lucrative and a peripheral activity. Maybe someday designer babies will be feasible as murding peopel to harvest their organs - yet remain as peripheral. Most people will not be involved in this new agenda. There will still be poverty, there will still be war and famine. Just like in the medieval ages, there were people living in castles having their own agendas while the rest lived in huts.(22)

Given our past record, we arelikely to reach out for bliss, divinity, and immortaility - even if it kills us.
The author looked at this paper as a historical analysis, not a political manifesto. The authors prediction is focues on what humankind will *try* to achieve in the twenty-first century - not what it will *succeed* in achieving. Our future economy, society, and politics will be shaped by the attempt to overcome death. What is the use of new knowledge if it doesn't lead to novel behaviors? Like deciphering the basic laws of the economy, everyone would be quick to use it to gain an advantage over their competitors. When people change their behaviors, the knowledge of how economies worked in the past will become obsolete. We won't know how it will function in the present, not to mention the future. (23)

The paradox of knowledege is that  knowledge that does not change behavior is useless, but knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance. THe more data we haveand the better we understand histrou, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge ecomes outaded. (24)


It was easy to say in the medieval ages, what Europe would look like in 1150, when someone was from 1100. There would still be famine, more peasants than surfs. Today, we have no idea how to predict what will happen in 50 years. (25)

The same technologies that can upgrade huamns into gods might also make humans irrelevant. For ecample, computers powerful enough to understand and overcome the mechanisms of ageing and death will probably also be powerful enough to replace humans in any and all tasks. Hence, the real agenda in the twenty-first centurary is going to be far more complicated than what this long opening chapter has suggested. (27)

Everything that has been suggested so far will be the predictions of the past 300 years. Therefore, it is merely the future of the past. The "Real future", a future born of the new ideas and hopes of the twenty-fist century - might be completely different. 
Talks about how we're still animals. "No investigation of our divine future can ignore our own animal past, or our relations with other animals." "You want to knwo how super-intelligent cyborgs might treat ordinary flesh-and-blood humans? Better start by investigating hwo huamns treat their less intelligent animal cousins." (28)

Humanism has dominated the world for 300 years, the pharophs for 3,000 years, and popes for a millennium. Many think the downfall for each were both positive developments. People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. but the single greatest constant of histroy is that everything changes. (29)

Aren't we guilty of humanising anmials? i.e. ascribing human qualities to non-human entities, like children believing that dolls feel love and anger? (30)

All mammals evolved emotional abilities and needs. Emotions are biochemical algorithms that are vital for the surival and repodcution of all mammals. He then goes into explaining what an algorithm is. (31)

Talks of the algothrim if a coffee machine. "Over the last few decades biologists have reached the firm conclusion that the man presing the buttons and drinking the ttea is also an algorithm." Humans are algorithms that produce copies of themsleves. Talks about the a survival problem: A baboon wanting a banana while there is a lion lurking nearby. How far are the bananas? How about the lion? Will it survive without the bananas? How fast can it run? Are the bananas big or small? ripe? (32)

External data, if the monkey is starving, it will go against all odds, if it not, and the bananas are green, why take the risk for greed? A timid baboon who overestimates danger will starve to death, and a rash baboon who underestimates danger will get killed for his reckless genes. The baboon didn't figure this out on their own, their entire bodies are the calculator. What we call sensations and emotions are in fact algorithms.  (33)

Goes into talking about how the same is true for reproduction. Animals don't think, if I mate with this person, our genes will be strong and produce strong babies, they just feel them. Same is true with humans when it comes to spouses , careers and habits. These decisions are made by the highly refined algorightms we call sensations, emotions and desires.  (34)

Motherly love, something we share between mammals (35)

This information is fairly new to science. Childcare experts used to warn that children who were hugged and kissed by their parents would grow up to be needy, egotistical and insecure adults. In the 1920s they use to suggest never to hug and kiss your children, and to shake their hands in the morning. It will not hurt the baby to cry, if they demand to be fed during a time that is not their feeding hours. This is to install discipline, yikes. Emotional needs science was introduced in the 1950s and 60s. Experiment of baby monkeys being separated from their mothers, and discovering that they can't survive with food alone, they need emotional bonds too. (36)

Baby monkeys that grew up without mothers became antisocial and neurotic adults. Goes into how fucked up it is for mammals to be raised without mothers. Then comes back **full circle** and talks about how the diary industry is ripping kids from their parents by the billions, and how they're all lacking that emotional bond. Going back to talking about how superhumans would treat us...(37)

Making the connections between animals and religion. Annubis was depicted as a jackel, and jesus as a lamb. Gods explained waht is so epecial about sapiens and why humans should domiant and exploit all other organisms. Christiantiy, for example maintained that humans hold sway over the rest of creation because the creator chraged them with that authroity. God gave an eternal soul only to humans. Everything else are mere extras, making humans the apex of creation. God had to mediate between humans and the ecosystem. In the animistic cosmos, everyone talked with everyone directly. If you wanted more milk, the clouds to bring more rain, the locusts to stay away from your crops, you would pray to god.  (39)

God would give it to us, so long as we did something in return. This deal served both parties, at the expense of the rest of the ecosystem (40)
