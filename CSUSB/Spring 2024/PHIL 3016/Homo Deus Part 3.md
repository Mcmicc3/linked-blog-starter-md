If we have the power to engineer death and pain out of our system, taht same power will orobably be sufficeint to engineer our system in almost any manner we like, and maniuplate our orgfans emotions and intelligence in myriad ways. Have the strength of Hercules, the sensuality of Aphrodite, or the wisdom of Athena.  (pg 1)

The uprgrading of humasn into gods may follow any of three pathsL biologhical engineering, cyborg engineering and the engineering of non-organic beings. 
Biological engineering suggests that homo sapiens are not the pinnacle evolution point for homo erectus. Bio engineers will create new godlings, with rewired brain circuits and genetically engineered limbs. 
The other theory is cyberborgs, where we will merge our bodies with machines. Cyborgs can exist in numerous places at the same time. (Eye surgery in tokyo, body in mars, mind in the office)
(pg 2)

Doctors connecting their minds to surgical instruments. We already have technology where amputees are using bionic limbs, or operate computers from their thoughts alone. Monkeys do this already. 
Cyborg theory assumes that organic brains will go on being the command - and control centres of life. 
a bolder approach hopes to dispense organic parts altogether, to engineer completely non-organic beings. Machines that can transverse the physical and digital realm, free from the limitations of organic chemsitry.  (pg 3)

Predicting the future in regards to homo deus is even harder since they can be used to transform human minds and desires, people with present day minds and desires cannot fathom their implications. 
For thousands of years, everything has evolved and changed, but what stayed consistent is our humanity. 
Once technology enables us to re-engineer human minds, homo sapiens will disappear, human histroy will come to an end and a completelty new kind of process will begin. 
Predicting 100 years into the future is a waste of time. "What would people with minds like ours fo with biotechnology?" All we can say is that people similar to our own minds, would be interested in trying to re-engineer their own minds. (4)

Divinity isn't a vague metaphysical quality. When talking about creating humans into gods, think of greek gods or Hindu Devas.
Our ability to quickly communicate with people around the world is almost godlike. (5) 

In ancient agriculutural socieities, most religions involved aroudn the mundane issue of increasing agricultural output. Listen to god and obey his commands so the sky produces rain and the crops grow large. Humans figured out how to gentically modify crops and be self relient in ensuring a good harvest. Isreal also built a huge desalination plant on the shores of the mediterranian sea, so they can have all the drinking water they want. We're competing with the gods of old. superhumans will outstrip ancient gods through bodily and mental faculties. Humans will make a bid for divinity. (6)

The evolution of humans merging with technology, or altering their DNA will take a long time. Not over night, and one day they'll look  back and realize they have little in common with the people who wrote the bible (7)

what will happen once the human experience becomes just another
designable product, no different in essence from any other item in
the supermarket? (8)

What will people do all day when technology is running the show? Do drugs and play video games? Virtual Reality? Yet such a development would deal a mortal blow
to the liberal belief in the sacredness of human life and of human
experiences. Some people like Nick Bostrom thinkgs AI might
simply exterminate humankind. The AI is likely to do so either for
fear that humankind would turn against it and try to pull its plug,
or in pursuit of some unfathomable goal of its own.  **Waste?**

**The second threat facing liberalism is that in the future, while the system might still need**
**humans,** it will not need individuals. machines will make most of the important decisions for humans. . 10 

Efven if the FBI or KGB recordered every phone call and every random encounter of me on the streets, they couldn't possible have an accurate undersatnding of myself, than how I know myself because it's too much data to go through. No more. authority will shift from individual humans to networked algorithms. People will no longer see themselves as autonomous
beings running their lives according to their wishes, and instead
become accustomed to seeing themselves as a collection of
biochemical mechanisms that is constantly monitored and guided
by a network of electronic algorithms. 11

This external algorithm will know me better than I know myself, and will make fewer mistakes than me. It will make sense to trust this algorithm for my life devisions and choices.
Talks about how we use diabetic machines to look at our sugar levels. Talks about a mechanical pancreas than monitors blood and sends insulin and glucagon on its own. 
Other people with no serious illness have already started wearing sensors and computers to monitor their health and activities. 12

for others this is already an ideology, if not a religion. The
Quantified Self movement argues that the self is nothing but
mathematical patterns. These patterns are so complex that the
human mind has no chance of understanding them. So if you wish
to obey the old adage and know thyself, you should not waste your
time on philosophy, meditation or psychoanalysis, but rather you
should systematically collect biometric data and allow algorithms
to analyse them for you and tell you who you are and what you
should do. The movement’s motto is ‘Self-knowledge through
numbers’
People who experience themselves through the unrelenting
mediation of such devices may begin to see themselves as a
collection of biochemical systems more than as individuals, and
their decisions will increasingly reflect the conflicting demands of
the various systems.  13

# The latest studies indicate that a weekly game of chess can help delay the onset of dementia

We often think of old people as weak but wise with 80 years of advice to give. Twenty-first-
century octogenarians don’t always look like that. Thanks to our
growing understanding of human biology, medicine keeps us alive
long enough for our minds and our ‘authentic selves’ to
disintegrate and dissolve. All too often, what’s left is a collection of
dysfunctional biological systems kept going by a collection of
monitors, computers and pumps
Talks about Angelina Jolie having a double mastectomy because she carried a dangerous gene that was 87% likely to become breast cancer. 14

Talks about listening to your body and connecting to your feelings to see if you're okay. Your body would say relax, everything is fine, but a computer algorithm used by her doctors told a
different story: ‘You don’t feel anything is wrong, but there is a
time bomb ticking in your DNA. Do something about it – now!’
Talks about how her personality contributed to her decision making. Asked what about a situation where a DNA test proved that your brain has a mutation that makes it a lot more likely to underestimate danger.  You will accept the algorithms judgement and follow what it says. This is not an apocalyptic scenario. The algorithms won’t revolt and enslave
us. Rather, the algorithms will be so good in making decisions for
us that it would be madness not to follow their advice. 15

Talks about Angelinas movie cyborg 2, robot programmed with human emotions. When Casella discovers that Pinwheel
Robotics not only controls her, but also intends to terminate her,
she escapes and fights for her life and freedom. Cyborg 2 is a
liberal fantasy about an individual fighting for liberty and privacy
against global corporate octopuses. **In her real life,** Jolie preferred to sacrifice privacy and autonomy for health. A similar desire to improve human health may well
cause most of us to **willingly dismantle the barriers protecting our**
**private spaces, and allow state bureaucracies and multinational**
**corporations access to our innermost recesses.** For instance,
allowing Google to read our emails and follow our activities would
make it possible for Google to alert us to brewing epidemics before
they are noticed by traditional health services.
How does the UK National Health Service know that a flu
epidemic has erupted in London? By **analysing the reports of**
**thousands of doctors in hundreds of clinics**
The doctor types the data
into the computer, and somebody up in NHS headquarters
hopefully analyses this data together with reports streaming in
from thousands of other doctors, concluding that flu is on the
march. All this takes a lot of time. Google could do it in **minutes**. 
16

Suppose on an average day the words ‘headache’,
‘fever’, ‘nausea’ and ‘sneezing’ appear 100,000 times in London
emails and searches. If today the Google algorithm notices they
appear 300,000 times, then bingo! We have a flu epidemic. {**How would it tell apart from students making searches?**}
However, for Google to work its magic, Mary must allow Google
not only to read her messages, but also to share the information
with the health authorities. If Angelina Jolie was willing to
sacrifice her privacy in order to raise awareness of breast cancer,
why shouldn’t Mary make a similar sacrifice in order to fight
epidemics? {**Are there laws preventing this?**}
This isn’t a theoretical idea. In 2008 Google actually launched
**Google Flu Trends**, that tracks flu outbreaks by monitoring Google
searches. The service is still being developed, and due to privacy
limitations it tracks only search words and allegedly avoids
reading private emails. But it is **already capable of ringing the flu**
**alarm bells ten days before traditional health services**
More **ambitious project** Google Baseline Study.
Google intends to build a mammoth database on human health,
establishing the ‘perfect health’ profile. This will hopefully make it
possible to identify even the smallest deviations from the baseline,
thereby alerting people to burgeoning health problems such as
cancer when they can be nipped in the bud. DNA testing is growing in leaps and bounds, such as 23andMe 17

‘Know thyself’ was never easier or
cheaper. Since it is all based on statistics, the size of the company’s
database is the key to making accurate predictions. Hence the first
company to build a giant genetic database will provide customers
with the best predictions, and will potentially corner the market.
US biotech companies are increasingly worried that strict privacy
laws in the USA combined with Chinese disregard for individual
privacy may **hand China the genetic market on a plate.** if we give Google and its
competitors free access to our biometric devices, to our DNA scans
and to our medical records, we will get an all-knowing medical
health service, which will not only fight epidemics, but will also
shield us from cancer, heart attacks and Alzheimer’s. 
Imagine a system that, in the words of the famous Police song, watches
every breath you take, every move you make and every bond you
break. A system that monitors your bank account and your
heartbeat, your sugar levels and your sexual escapades. **It will**
**definitely know you much better than you know yourself.** The self-
deceptions and self-delusions that trap people in bad
relationships, wrong careers and harmful habits will not fool
Google 18

Google will actually remember every step we took and every hand
we shook. Many people will be happy to transfer their decisions making processes into a machine, or atleast consult with it. 
‘Listen, Google,’ I will say, ‘both John and Paul are
courting me. I like both of them, but in a different way, and it’s so
hard to make up my mind. Given everything you know, what do
you advise me to do?’
And Google will answer: ‘Well, **I know you from the day you**
**were born.** I have read all your emails, recorded all your phone
calls, and know your favourite films, your DNA and the entire
history of your heart. I have exact data about each date you went
on, and if you want, I can show you second-by-second graphs of
your heart rate, blood pressure and sugar levels whenever you
went on a date with John or Paul. If necessary, I can even provide
you with accurate mathematical ranking of every sexual encounter
you had with either of them. And naturally enough, **I know them**
**as well as I know you**. Based on all this information, on my superb
algorithms, and on decades’ worth of statistics about millions of
relationships – I advise you to go with John, with an 87 per cent
probability of being more satisfied with him in the long run
‘Indeed, I know you so well that I also know you don’t like this
answer. Paul is much more handsome than John, and because you
give external appearances too much weight, you secretly wanted
me to say “Paul” 19

In exchange for such devoted counselling services, we will just
have to **give up the idea that humans are individuals,** and that
each human has a free will determining what’s good, what’s
beautiful and what is the meaning of life. Humans will no longer
be autonomous entities directed by the stories their narrating self
invents. **Instead, they will be integral parts of a huge global**
**network**. 20

The new religions are unlikely to emerge from the caves of
Afghanistan or from the madrasas of the Middle East. Rather, they
will emerge from research laboratories.
in the coming decades new techno-religions may conquer the
world by promising salvation through algorithms and genes.
techno-religions can be divided into **two main types**:
**techno-humanism and data religion**. Data religion argues that
humans have completed their cosmic task, and they should now
pass the torch on to entirely new kinds of entities. We will discuss
the dreams and nightmares of data religion in the next chapter.
This chapter is dedicated to the more conservative creed of
techno-humanism, which still sees humans as the apex of creation
and clings to many traditional humanist values. Techno-
humanism agrees that Homo sapiens as we know it has run its
historical course and will no longer be relevant in the future, but
concludes that we should therefore use technology in order to
create Homo deus – a much superior human model. Homo deus
will retain some essential human features, but will also enjoy upgraded physical and mental abilities that will enable it to hold
its own even against the most sophisticated non-conscious
algorithms 21 

As far as we know, this earth-shattering revolution {**From apes to splitting the atom and reaching the moon**} resulted from a few small changes in the
Sapiens DNA, and a slight rewiring of the Sapiens brain. If so, says
techno-humanism, maybe a few additional changes to our genome
and another rewiring of our brain will suffice for launching a
second cognitive revolution. Hitler and his ilk
planned to create superhumans by means of selective breeding
and ethnic cleansing, twenty-first-century techno-humanism
hopes to reach the goal far more peacefully, with the help of
genetic engineering, nanotechnology and brain–computer
interfaces
Techno-humanism seeks to **upgrade the human mind and give us**
**access to unknown experiences and unfamiliar states of**
**consciousness**. However, revamping the human mind is an
extremely complex and dangerous undertaking 22

We don't understand the human brain yet.
We are akin to the inhabitants of a small isolated island who
have just invented the first boat, and are about to set sail without a
map or even a destination. Indeed, we are in a somewhat worse
condition. The inhabitants of our imaginary island at least know
that they occupy just a small space within a large and mysterious
sea. We fail to appreciate that we are living on a tiny island of
consciousness within a giant ocean of alien mental states 23



How come we have a remarkarbly detailed atlas of a sick mind, but have no scientific map of the propserous mind?  Over the last two decades, positive psychology
has made important first steps in the study of super-normative
mental states, but as of 2016, the super-normative zone is largely
terra incognita to science
For thousands of years the system
has been shaping and reshaping our minds according to its needs.
Sapiens originally evolved as members of small intimate
communities, and their mental faculties were not adapted to living
as cogs within a giant machine. However, with the rise of cities,
kingdoms and empires, the system cultivated capacities required
for large-scale cooperation, while disregarding other skills and
talents.
For example, archaic humans probably made extensive use of
their sense of smell. Hunter-gatherers are able to smell from a
distance the difference between various animal species, various
humans and even various emotions.
25

The same thing happened to our other senses, and to the
underlying ability to pay attention to our sensations. Ancient
foragers were always sharp and attentive. Wandering in the forest
in search of mushrooms, they sniffed the wind carefully and
watched the ground intently. When they found a mushroom, they
ate it with the utmost attention, aware of every little nuance of
flavour, which could distinguish an edible mushroom from its
poisonous cousin. **Members of today’s affluent societies don’t need**
**such keen awareness.** We can go to the supermarket and buy any
of a thousand different dishes, all supervised by the health
authorities. But whatever we choose – Italian pizza or Thai
noodles – we are likely to eat it in haste in front of the TV, hardly
paying attention to the taste (which is why food producers are
constantly inventing new exciting flavours, which might somehow
pierce the curtain of indifference). Similarly, when going on
holiday we can choose between thousands of amazing
destinations. But wherever we go, we are likely to be playing with
our smartphone instead of really seeing the place. **We have more**
**choice than ever before, but no matter what we choose, we have**
**lost the ability to really pay attention to it**. 
We also don't dream anymore
26

Mathematical skills are more important to the economy than
smelling flowers or dreaming about fairies. For similar reasons, it
is likely that future upgrades to the human mind will reflect
political needs and market forces
Humanist
psychologists have pointed out that people in distress often don’t
want a quick fix – they want somebody to listen to them and
sympathise with their fears and misgivings. 
Friend telling you quickly to quiet or do the job at hand. 
he attention helmet works a bit like the impatient friend. Of
course sometimes – on the battlefield, for instance – people need
to take firm decisions quickly. But there is more to life than that. If
we start using the attention helmet in more and more situations,
we may end up losing our ability to tolerate confusion, doubts and
contradictions, just as we have lost our ability to smell, dream and
pay attention. **The system may push us in that direction, because it**
**usually rewards us for the decisions we make rather than for our**
**doubts**. Yet a life of resolute decisions and quick fixes may be
poorer and shallower than one of doubts and contradictions.
27

**The system may prefer**
**downgraded humans** not because they would possess any
superhuman knacks, but because they would lack some really
disturbing human qualities that hamper the system and slow it
down. As any farmer knows, **it’s usually the brightest goat in the**
**herd that stirs up the greatest trouble, which is why the**
**Agricultural Revolution involved downgrading animal mental**
**abilities.** The second cognitive revolution dreamed up by techno-
humanists might do the same to us
Techno-humanism faces another dire threat. Like all humanist
sects, techno-humanism too sanctifies the human will, seeing it as
the nail on which the entire universe hangs. **Techno-humanism**
**expects our desires to choose which mental abilities to develop,**
**and to thereby determine the shape of future minds.** Yet what
would happen once technological progress makes it possible to
reshape and engineer our desires themselves?
People having inner dialoge. "Should I have a kid? Am I dissasitfied because I'm in a failing marriage? Am I gay? Am I guilty for the war crimes I committed"
**humanism demands** that we show some guts, **listen to the inner**
**messages even if they scare us,** identify our authentic voice and
then follow its instructions regardless of the difficulties.
**Technological progress has a very different agenda. It wants to control it**
28

Once
we understand the biochemical system producing all these voices,
**we can play with the switches, turn up the volume here, lower it**
**there, and make life much more easy and comfortable**. We’ll give
Ritalin to the distracted lawyer, Prozac to the guilty soldier and
Cipralex to the dissatisfied wife. And that’s just the beginning.
According to
modern psychiatry, **many ‘inner voices’ and ‘authentic wishes’ are**
**nothing more than the product of biochemical imbalances and**
**neurological diseases.** People suffering from clinical depression
repeatedly walk out on promising careers and healthy
relationships because some **biochemical glitch makes them see**
**everything through dark-coloured lenses**. Instead of listening to
such destructive inner voices, it might be a good idea to shut them up. 
As we learn to turn our inner volume up and down, we give up our
belief in authenticity, because it is no longer clear whose hand is
on the switch. Silencing annoying noises inside your head seems
like a wonderful idea, provided it enables you to finally hear your
deep authentic self. But if there is no authentic self, how do you
decide which voices to silence and which to amplify?
29

‘Doc, here’s $100,000. Please fix me so that I will never want men
again.’ He then rings the bell, and the door is opened by a real-life
George Clooney. ‘Doc,’ mumbles the overwhelmed lad, ‘here’s
$100,000. Please fix me so that I will never want to be straight
again.’
**Did the young man’s authentic self win over the religious**
**brainwashing he underwent? Or perhaps a moment’s temptation**
**caused him to betray himself?** And perhaps there is simply no
such thing as an authentic self that you can follow or betray? Once
people could design and redesign their will, we could no longer see
it as the ultimate source of all meaning and authority. For no
matter what our will says, we can always make it say something
else

would have been avoided if instead of drinking poison, **Romeo and**

in order to make the right decisions you must get to know
yourself better. But if you want to know yourself in the twenty-first
century, there are much better methods than climbing mountains,
going to museums or writing diaries. Here are some practical
Dataist guidelines for you:
‘You want to know who you really are?’ asks Dataism. ‘Then
forget about mountains and museums. Have you had your DNA
sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today.
Not god, not the stars, not the bible, dataism
36

And convince your grandparents, parents and siblings to have
their DNA sequenced too – their data is very valuable for you. And
have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that
measure your blood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a
day? Good – so buy one of those, put it on and connect it to your
smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera
and microphone, record everything you do, and put in online. And
allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails, monitor all
your chats and messages, and keep a record of all your Likes and
clicks. If you do all that, then the great algorithms of the Internet-
of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to pursue
and whether to start a warBut where do these great algorithms come from? This is the
mystery of Dataism. Just as according to Christianity we humans
cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism says the human
brain cannot embrace the new master algorithms. At present, of
course, the algorithms are mostly written by human hackers. Yet
the really important algorithms – such as the Google search
algorithm – are developed by huge teams. Each member
understands just one part of the puzzle, and nobody really
understands the algorithm as a whole. Moreover, with the rise of
machine learning and artificial neural networks, more and more
algorithms evolve independently, improving themselves and
learning from their own mistakes
