1. What are the biggest problems with consequentialism?
2. What does Kant think the true source of moral worth is, and why that? Or in other words, what does Kant think is the only _truly good thing_?
3. How do you figure out your duties and evaluate the morality of an action?


Example of a drunk driver killing someone, vs a drunk driver hitting a lost wedding ring somehow leading to the owner finding it
- Drunk driving is morally wrong (According to?), but to a consequentialist, they would say the first driver is morally bad

Example of two different couples where one partner thinks of cheating all the time but never does it, whereas the other couple, no one thinks of cheating and never does it.
- Consequentialist, by not cheating, they are morally equal
- This feels off?





- **Desire**, I want to eat ice cream everyday.
- **Reasoning** tells me this is not a good idea because I will be unhealthy
- **Will** fulfils those orders (discipline). The part of you that says no

Kant thinks normal personality traits of whether someone has a good personality or not, or not signs or worth using to measure if someone is good morally.
- People can have good qualities, but if their will is bad, they are bad

Thanos is smart, calm, level headed
- Kant would ask if his actions are good.

If the purpose for life is just for us to be happy all the time with a life of pleasure, wouldn't be operating all the time in desire, rather than reason?

Why do we have reasoning?
- To be in control
- Have a good will

All our reason is used to produce good will
- Everything to do with the concept of duty
- Doing something for duty vs other reasons
- Doing things with a sense of duty

Saving a cat from a fire but breaking down a door, and you end up saving a few people too
- Consequentialist will say good
- Kant will say morally not good because your intent was to save the cat

If people act a certain way reasons other than duty, then that action does not have moral worth

- If you give to charity because it makes you feel good, it's not a moral action
- If you give to charity because you don't give a shit but know it's the right thing to do, it is moral.

# Article notes
Mental talents like intelligence, wit, and judgement. Termperaments such as courage, resoluteness, and perserverence and gifts of nature. Good to have, but what matters most is the character of the person who has these gifts. 

"What makes a good will good ? It isn’t what it brings about,
its usefulness in achieving some intended end. Rather, good
will is good because of how it wills —i.e. it is good in itself."
