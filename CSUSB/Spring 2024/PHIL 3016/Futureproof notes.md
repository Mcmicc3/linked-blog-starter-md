The Industrial Revolution made trades like rope making, blacksmiths, farmhands, and other manual labor careers as irrelevant. 

The first thing I learned is that in general AI is better than jhumns at operating in stable environments with static well0defined rules and consistent inputs. On the other hand**, **humans are much better than AI at handling surprises, filling in gaps, or operatiung in environments with poorly defined rules or incomplete environments.**** 

"If it has a manual and you can teach another employee to do your job in a month, it will probably be replaced by AI". AI can be a great secretary, but it would be a horrible kindergarden teacher.

humans are social beings. what that means is that **jobs that tap into our social desires -** bartenders, hair stylists, flight attendants, mental health workers - **will be hard to automate.** People who are skilled at creating social and emotional experiences will be better positioned for the future than people whose primary skill is making or doing things efficiently. 
**emotional intelligence.** 

**When machines can do many of the basic, repetitive functions of our jobs as well or better than we can, what's left for us will be the social and emotional parts.** This is why Kayak, Expedia, and Orbitz are successful. 

Umans are much netter than AI at work that involves **unusual cominatations of skills**, high-stakes situationsm, or extraordinary talen. I call this tytpe of work "scarce: but not becasue there are only a few of these jobs to go around. Instead this is work that will be either impractical or socially unacceable to automate because it ins't needed on a constant, predicatble basis." 

Maria popova, thec creator of hte brain pickings blog, calls this trait, combinational creativty. She writes that many of history's great breakthroughs have been generated not by hyper-specialization, but by combining insights form two or more different field . Einstein said that playing the violin helped connect different parts of his brain while working on physics problems. **For now, combinational creativity is a uniquely human skill*. 

Another job that's **hard to automate** is work that involves **rare or high-stake situations** with low fault tolerance. We want human 911 operators, wedding planners, and doctors. Noone wants to complain to a web portal, we want to complain to a human. 

The final kind of scarce work that is almost certainly safe from automation is work that requires extraordinary talent. World-class athletes, prize-winning chefs, and people with standout acting or singing abilities . If someone would pay to watch you do your job, you're safe. **Humans still want role models. We like bearing witness to human greatness**. 


Story of a book store owner, Marcus Books, who created a community book store, and how he became very successful after the pandemic. He had a community, employees who've actually read the books in the store. It was a hub to socailize, **It has kept humanity front and center, and as a result, it has made itself irreplaceable**. 

Back to that guy in 1821, he got into the cabinetmaking trade, because it's a task that didn't lend itself to mass production. Lovett eventually became active in labor organizing - a deeply interpersonal endeavor, and one that made him a sought-after ally as british workers fought for expanded rights and protections. **In a time of technological advancements, he figured out how to stay ahead of the curve, by centering his humanity in his work. He realized that his intellect, his relationshpis, and his moral courage made him much more valuable than a machine and acted accordingly.**

## Rule 3

Demote your devices

That feeling when you feel a buzz from your phone, and your mind starts to wonder all the many different reasons it could be buzzing. Then getting stuck doom scrolling while life happens around you.

A lot of people felt like they could relate to the authors experience after detoxing. His wife felt like she got him back.


## Rule 4

Story of Mitsuru Kawai, and how he doubled down and became a *monozukuri*, at a time when his job was threatned to be replaced by automation.

Talks abouut hustle culture and people who make their job their identities, as well as people who brag for working really hard. 

Hand made things and things that are created with the real human experience, like clay bowls, will have greater value than anything that could be mass produced by a robot. Artists and artisans won't be replaced by AI. 

Talks about the Facebook feature that allows you to say happy birthday to people, and how it's less special because of the app, people didn't go out of their way to tell you anything special, only waht the app suggestd.

the more obvious the human effort behind something, the higher its perceived value
the humans whos jobs will be replaced will need to get creative and figure out ways to make the value of their contributions more evident.

## Rule #2

The idea of "machine drift". There are things in your life that are very easy to predict. What you like to eat, watch, dress. Now we have algorithms on social media and youtube that can predict what you like to watch or read, and see you can mindlessly go down a rabbit hole watching things, or accepting all the suggested text given to us by AI (responses to emails like OKAY, or WILL DO). AAccpeint whatever the algorithm gives you, puts you in what the author calls machine drift

Machine drift can happen outside of technology too. When you become very politcally polarizing, or questioning if you actually liked the shoes you bought online, or if you only trusted the algorithms recommendation. 

The story of tapestry, an algorithm that sorts emails by their importance and relevancy, was the start of the recommendation engine.

Recommender systems of the past  were designed to save us time, but many of today's recommenders are designed to take time from us. 

80 percent of movies viewed on Netflix, came from recommendations. They claim it saved them a billion dollars a year. The psychological power of recommendations was made clear in a 2018 study led by Gediminas Adomavicius, a professor at the University of Minnesota. 

Choice archetecture could be good for apps like Yelp that show you suggestions close to you, and not waste your time with bad suggestions. However, companies can be biased to their own products, like Amazon, or Netflix (can steer you to their original shows). "The pwoer to change users preferences at scale has moade some technologist uncomforatable. Rachel Schutt, a data scientists, said as much in a 2012 interview with the times. "Models do not just predict, but they can make things happen", A former product manager from Facebook said that recommendation algorithms amounted to an attempt to *reprogram humans*". 

People walk in, and disregard their own experiences and prior beliefs once they're recommended something by the algorithm. 
In recent years, techn companies have figured out that mind chaniging algorithms area a lucrative prospect. Targeted advertising - the business that has made Google and Facebook two of ht em ost valuable compaines in the world -- combines both "Read our minds " and "Change our minds" technology by analyzing data to guess users' preferences, then allowing advertisers to pay to attempt to change their minds. 

Today's recommender algorithms are so powerful and so deeply embedded in our systems, that they often function more like *decider algorithms*. By ranking certain informationm ore highly, or prioritiuzung the choices ina   certain way, they can create the illusion of free will, while actually steering users down a path toward their preferred outcome.  What makes machine drift so dangerous is that at a time whenwe most need our human faculties to help guide us, these algorithms are actively eroding th eparts of ourselves that makle us most human: *our ability to change course, to pursue difficult goals, to make unpopular choices that cut agains the grain.* They're discouraging us from building the jidn of personal autoonomy that will protect us in the age of AI and automation, by allowing us to think andact for ourselves. And they're doing it under the guise of helping us.

If there is less friction in doing something, we are more likely to do it. Whatever tech service is being offered, their goal is to make it frictionless so it is seemessly easy to sign up for the service. Often "eliminating friction" in a tech product simply means transgerring the burden to a low-paid worker. These models are teaching us to always pick the easy option, and not do things like trying new experiences, or overcoming tough obstacles. 

Resisting machine drift. Take inventory of your own preferences. Think of all your daily choices, and determine which of those choices are truly yours, and which are fundamentally shaped by a machines instructions or suggestions.

Another way to resist is to implement what he calls *Human hour*. Do something that doesn't involve looking at a screen for an hour. Do things like read a newspaper, steam some milk for your coffee, take the scenic route home, these are all *minor inconviences*. 


## Middle of rule 3

Funny experiment of participants shocking themselves rather than having to deal with their own boredom. 

The intention of the detox program was to to rediscover what was fascinating and energizing about the offline world. *Think of the bigger picutre of what you're getting by not being on Twitter all the time.*
