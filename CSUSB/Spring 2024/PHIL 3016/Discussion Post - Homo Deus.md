Balancing ones actions so that their traits are not excessive, or deficient. By doing so, one could live and act through virtuous traits, such as Courage, Discipline, humility, discipline.

2.  
a.  Everything has a function. The humans function is to reason.   
b. To be virtuous, you shouldn't do things in excess or deficient

I think the argument only works, if the individual has good character. Not in terms of good qualities, but with what a person does with those good qualities as in working in their own self interest, regardless if their actions might do more harm at the end of a day.  Everyone serves a function, but not every person produces good results, and the same is true even with people who have good qualities.

If a humans purpose is to function with reason, what happens when that reason takes them into doing awful things, and they function well doing those things. Can bad people still be virtuous? If they can be, would that make virtue, not, the best method for determining morality?

  
"Golden mean"

Virtue is the middle point between doing this in excess and deficiently
