1. _The big picture_. Identify the conclusion of the selection you’ve read. Ask yourself: What’s the main point that the author is trying to make? If I had to sum up this reading in one sentence, what would I say?

The main point that the author is making in his paper, is that death is natural and not in itself inherently evil, or something that should be feared.  

2. _Analysis_. Identify and explain 2-3 key ideas in support of the author’s main point. Ask yourself: Which 2-3 ideas seem to be critical “building blocks” in support of the main point?

One of the key points the author makes is that death is simply a state of being, and if there's anything potentially evil about it, it's other arbitrary attachments we give death, such as the potential for a long life.
*If death is an evil, it is the loss of life, rather than the state of being dead, or non-existent, or unconscious, that is objectionable.* All death is tragic regardless of age, however, it's all the same whether we look at death as the end to a tragic life lived, or the end of a positive story. 

The second key point the author makes for his argument is that death is a part of nature, and nature simply is. Whether it's good or bad is subjective, and we should look at death as a natural part of life.
*What is death? Someone looking at death per se, and*  
*applying the analytical power of his mind to divest*  
*death of its associated images, will conclude then*  
*that it is nothing more than a function of nature —*  
*and if anyone is frightened of a function of nature,*  
*he is a mere child.* 


3. _Critical engagement_. Do you find the author’s argument for the conclusion you mentioned above convincing? Why or why not? Give good reasons!

I do find the authors arguments to be convincing. I agree with the idea that the state of being dead is similar to the state of never existing. When you're dead, there is nothing within yourself that can experience what it is to be dead, so there's nothing to fear. I also agree with the idea that death in itself is not inherently evil. Everything naturally comes to an end, eventually. 

4. _Discussion question_. Formulate a critical question that aims to generate discussion on the forum.

I understand the authors reasoning for not exploring death, past the idea of what happens to a persons soul after death, but, I am curious to know what they would have thought for people who want their deaths to be mourned a certain way, like requesting people to play a specific song during their funeral, or even the idea of wills.
