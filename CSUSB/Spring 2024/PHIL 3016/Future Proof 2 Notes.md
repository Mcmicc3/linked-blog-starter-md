Rule 6: Give them a simple task. You don't want chaos. Show them how to mop the floor, but you wouldn't want chimps to do it unsupervised. Don't let it do major tasks. We ahve to be the manager of these AI tools. AIs can be WMD. Think of it, Is it opaque, damaging and scalable? 

Rule 7: Build big nets and small webs. 2 aspects. Both have to do with how we will support each other (humans) and get support for ourselves, when our lives change in significant ways because of AI. A lot of people will not ride out automation in their jobs. Whole fields of work will be gone. Make large scale programs and polciies that soften the blow of unemployment shochks. We should ahve big government level and polociies that help people who will become unemployed from AI. Right now, we're doing nothing. An idea being thrown around for now is medicare for all. So many people work now because their health insurance is tied to employment. We ahve priovate insurures. Most working folk depend on their job to pay for the premiums of their health insurance. With medicare, we would have healthcare even if we had a job or not. This would osften the blow of losing their job to AI. Another idea is giving financial incentives for people who got laid off because of AI.
Also make small webs. The informal local networks. How close knit and supportive or a human network do we have locally. We move all the time and lose touch with friends and family because of work, we don't go to church as much, volunteer or go to clubs. There's lots of ways that local communities have worn away lately, and it would benefit us to make local networks within our community. Family, friends, religious groups, volunteering, joining a club, would help build the small web. Innovation club is an idea of how that works here on campus. 

Rule 8 : Learn machine age humanities. Not philosphy classes or english lit class. Small age humanity. Skills that make you more hjuman **Soft skills.** Human skills that beneift us in the human age. Practical skills that can help anyone.  1. **attention guarding**. The ability to direct your attention and guard agaisnt distraction. Sometimes we spend a lot of time on our phones and laptops, plugged into something. We often feel scattered. It's good to know, becayse its the background skill that makes the other skills possible. It wil be hard to connect with people if we don't listen. We need attention to pay attention to ourselves and construct an identity for ourselves. Most people are scatted. 2. **Room reading**. Can you quickly asses the biases and prejeduces of others? can you code switch quickly?  LGTBQ people who spend more time in the closet, Will be more setup for the future, becasue they have a high degree of attention and personal attention to others. Quickly asses the biases and prejucides of others are helpful for people of color. 3. **Resting**. We come from a culture where we think we need to be producticve and hustle all the time. To pay better attention to others, we have to be well rested. Our valuable conrtributions to the world will come from emotional intelligence and creative ideas. We need to rest and recover to do that well. Learn how to take a nap and take a break from technology. 4. **Digital discernment** the abilitiy to read the internet skillfully, and encounter information, and know if it is realible and true. Don't fall into biases. Filter information effectively, and don't get duped5. **Analog ethics** we should try to be better people in real life, more ehtical, more moral in social behaviors. Doens't matter which type of ethics we follow, all of them are ways for us to think through how can we be a better, more thoughtufl person, this makes us more unuqiely human,.  6. **Consequentialism** just learn to think about and predict the downstream consequences of AI and technology, device and social media use. As we incoorpate more tehcnology, we need people who can forsue issues in the future, rather than blindly using it. They can think downstream and understand the consequentes of using more technology

Rule 9: Arm the rebels. Compares henry david through and sarah bagly, 1835, industrialization, both liuved in massechseuts. In many ways the world looks the same as it did in 1835.......long quote.....We could be like Henry and smash our devices, climb into the mountains and escape technology. The author doens't think we should do that. Instead be like sarah who worked at a textstile, who saw how shitty it was, and instead become a labor organizer, she gave speeches and tried to get people into collective action. Ruth thinks we should also step into the conversation of technology and talk about how it effects our lives and fight for a better future. Machines will keep coming. What should we do? Instead of fighting against the machines, fight for people. Fight for ethical technologist, who will create devices that benefit humanity. *The clear my record example* A tool that helped people expunge things from their records for low level drug offenses. We should also boost technology that helps people, and not investors. Boost voices to people who talk about the harms of tehcnology, like the WMD lady. Woman who did reserach on AI, her research found something that is biased agaisnt dark skinned people. We should boost the voices of ethical technologists. The future is not a spectator sport, and AI is too important to be lef tot he bot builders. It is so easy, especailly when life gets crazy. Our social media makes it easy to peace out of the world, but if we want ot make the future a fairer, happier, more just place, then we should ste p into the conversation and get involved, to make it the way we want it to be. Just by taking this calss, we've thought about this idea longer than the averge person.




## Rule 5: Don't be an endpoint
"The human booking the appointment has no idea she was talking to an AI, Humans quickly becoming expensive API endpoints." 

Endpoints are special kind of web addresses that allow programs to communicate qwith other programs throught what's knowna s an API, or application program interface. Example of Tinder and Instagram. Tinder n eeds to make an API endpoint for Instagram if thwy want to give users the ability to sync the accounts
- In the receptionist example, the human receptionist in the google demo was serving as a point of connection between two pieces of software-Duplex and the salon's appointment calendar- and she was only necessary because thsle machines couldn't talk directly to each other yet.

**Endpoints: People whose jobs mainly consisted of taking directions from a machine or serving as a bridge between two or more incompatible machines.
- Security guard: Someone who checks visitors into the vuildings security system and presses a button to let them through: *Endpoint*
- Nurse practionire taking info from some tool and loading them into another device
- starbucks barista taking orders from an app, and then handing them off to a postmates courier
	- Two endpoints

Partially automated jobs fall into 2 categories
#### Category 1, Machine assisted jobs
Jobs in which humans direct and oversee the vast majority of work and use machines as their helpers
- Real estate agent who uses automated listing ssoftware to matcah clients with for-sale homes but shows up in person to take them to open hosues and guide them throguht hte home-buying process
- *Human-centered automation*

#### Category 2, Machine managed jobs
Most of the work is directed and overseen by machines, and humans act as the gap-fillers doing only the things the machines can't et do on their own. 
- Gig work for companies like Uber, Lyft, and Postmates, along with the work performed by Amazon warehouse workers, facebook, and Twitter content moderators, and other people whose jobs consist mainly of carrying out instructions given to them by a machine.

Less about collaborating with AI systems, and more about serving them. In these relatiponships, all of the power and leverage resides in the machines- humans are simply the plug and play accessories that follow orders, and that can be swapped out at will. 
**THESE MACHINE JOBS ARE THE ENDPIINTS, AND THEY'RE A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE.** 
- The goal of these jobs is simply bridging a technological gap that is in the process of being automated or trainging an automated system to acheive human-level perforamnce. 
- Whether you know it or not, you're training that software to someday replace you. 

Many endpoints exist in service, retail, and transportation. Also white-collar professions
Doctors hate computers because they're constantly met with relentless reminders of tasks they haven't completed, supoplications to correct our documentiation for billers, and daily, jaundiced reminders. 
- Doctors feel like they're just moving data from one location to another.
- The fear of being downgraded by intelligient machinary, rather than assisted by it. 

automation in 1970 with the general motors and robots made indivuduals feel like vegetables. 

In-person contanct with their collegaues have an advantage when it comes to doing the kinds of deeply human work we will need to do in the future.

Studies have found tha tgroups of peoople located in the same room solve problems more quickly than people who collaborate electronically, and that co-authros of academic papers who are located closer together geograohically tend to produce higher-quality research. 

While remote workers may be more producticve than office workers, they're often less creative. 

remember that a high techm ultrau productive workplace brought to its kneeds by disillusioned workers who were fed up with being treated like robots - could happen to your ogranization too.

If you can't switch jobs, suggst changes to your existing job that would make your work more human, and give you more control over your tools. 

If you can't do anything to make your job less of an endpoint, you need to come up with an escape plan. 

## Rule 6: Treat AI Like a Chimp Army

Story of entrepenuare who used an algorithm to make T-shirts taylord for specific people, but forget to exclude words from the database, which resulted in some horrific shirts showing up on peoples feed.

You would measure the chimps first, are they well behaved? aggresive? how much training and supervision do they need? 
*Whatever your risk tolerance was, I'm fairly confident that you wouldn't just invite the chimps in, give them badges and lanyards, and say Okay get to work!, and you sure as hell wouldn't **Put them in charge***
