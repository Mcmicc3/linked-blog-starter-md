1. What is Consequentialism? - Sometimes called utilitarianism. 
2. What is the main idea in Peter Singer's essay, "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"?
3. Why does Singer think that proximity and number of bystanders don't change our moral obligations?
4. How does Singer's argument "upset our moral categories," and how would it change our lives and world?

### Trolly problem
If we think about moving the lever to save more people by sacrificing an innocent, we're thinking like a consequentialism. 
- Pro's and COn
- Defining happiness, are actions are
- Actions are right if they have utility, promote pleasure and reduce pain.
- Only the utility of the action matters.
- The actual consequences is what matters most.

###### The motive doesn't matter
What if that person pulling the lever in their heart thinks, "I might get famous, people will love me"
- Self interest
Does the motive matter to a consequentialist?
- No, only the consequences

##### What about thoughts?
Leaving a flaming bag of shit on your neighbors doorstep.
- To a consequentilist, no, because there's no real action

But if we act on it
- It gives us pleaser
- action was meaningful to a conseq.

If we think about how they would be mad at us longer than we'd have pleasure, or think about how they'd be more fearful of our pranks
- We think about the prank being morally wrong because it produced more pain than pleasure

What if everybody hated this guy, and people threw a party?
- That would produce more pleasure than pain
- A consequentialist would say that the action was good because it produced more pleasure than pain.

#### Jeremy Bentham
Made a calculator to measure pleasure.

### Peter Singer article
Refugee crisis in india (70's). Famine, mass migration.
Easy preventable death.
He wanted to know if the government had a higher obligality to help them, than just sending them money. 


Whose picture is it?
- Who does it belong to?
- Whose in the picture?

By saying whose, we're assuming that it's a picture of something. 

We don't know the identify if the person asking, but we do know the identify of the man. 

The picture that the man is looking at, is a picture of himself. Here is my logic behind the answer. There are two people in this question, the man standing infront of the portrait, and an unknown character asking about the picture. Here's what we know by breaking down this quote. "that man's father is my father's son.". We know that in the picure there is a man, and we know there is a relationship between the man standing infront of the portait and the one inside the portrait. when he said "**my** father's son." In the first line, he stated that he has no brothers or sisters, therefore, his father only has one son. Because the mans father only had one son, We can make the connection between the mans father, and father of the man in the portait. Had the man have another brother, it could have been someone, but because he doesn't, we can conclude that the man is referring to himself, and it's a picture of himself that is in the portait. 


#### Kidding drowning in a pond moral example
You feel a morally obligated to help a child if you are abled and capable of saving them. Regardless if you may get your clothes muddy, or you may lose something like a cell phone.
From a consequentalist stand point, 
- Saving the child will create less pain
- You might get pleasure from being seen as a hero

What if the pond was running distance away. Is the moral obligation still the same?
- Yes
- You may feel psychologically less obligated because noone would suspect you being close enough to do something, but the obligation is still there

Suppose your best friend was there with you
- You feel less guilty because people were there and noone else did anything, but the obligation is still there. 
- It may feel less guilty because your friend won't do anything
- But it's still the moral thign to do

When there is preventable suffering
- Prevent it, unless you are sacrificing something of moral comparative difference 
1. Distance doesn't matter
2. Number of witnesses doesn't matter

## Objections

If everyone donates $5, I don't need to donate more than that
- Not everyone will do it
- Don't assume others will do it
- Prevent more suffering by donating more than $5 

If everyone gave as much as they could to the bengal crisis, they'd be swimming cash (money, food, shelter). Then everyone else would have made an unnecessary sacrifice.
- This paradox is only assumed if these actions are performed more or less, simulatneously, and happened unexpedictally. 
- Realisticly? No, this won't happen


#### We have things we don't need
Buying starbucks coffee or wearing a new shirt when you don't need one.
- This money could have been given to someone who needs it more.

Because there's more suffering from not donating, than not having the coffee, than the morally right thing to do is to donate the money

### Where do we draw the conduct between duty and charity?
Duty is, don't kill people or be violent

Good but not required, is donating to charity.

What if more charity acts felt more duty like? Would we get a better result in the world and prevent a lot of pain? Would it produce more pleasure from a lot of people?
- You feel good from giving


### So what? We should be working all the time to increase the balance of happiness over misery?
yes

### Isn't this a job for the government?
They don't, and if we were to do it instead, in mass, wouldn't that make the government obligated to do the same?

#### Won't we cause more suffering by prolonging the lives of suffering people?
- Population control mentality
- You are to support those causes to prevent suffering

#### Marginal utility
By giving more, you would cause as much suffering to your indepndence, as you are releived by your gift. 
- You're not obligaetd to give until you can't make rent or feed yourself or your children
