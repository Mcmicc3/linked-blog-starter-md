Theories of death recording (earlier centuries often recording suicides as accidents), guns in home theory, decline in religious affiliation theory, change in family structure theory (increase divorce).

Author coined "constraints on independence theory".

Talks about teenagers from the 1990 to 2005 wanting a PC, and how they were able to teach their parents about computers. Role reversal, independence. Your kid is the master and now you're the apprentice.

Sales people at Sears selling computers, are teenagers. Teenagers are hired to learn how to use computers at universities, and are paid to teach professors how to use it.  That was before the university acquired a fleet of professional information technologists. 

 there was a time when, to a considerable degree, teenagers (and
sometimes younger children too!) were valued for their remarkable ability to
figure out this new technology and teach it to us slower-witted adults. That
must have increased kids’ sense of agency and decreased their depression and
despair.

The next generation of kids had parents who already knew how to work with computers, and those jobs became filled by IT professionals. The special role of teens declined and
maybe that helps explain why depression and suicide rates started trekking
upward again. 

Sociologists and anthropologists who have studied children worldwide have
observed that children normally—in other cultures and in ours until about half a
century ago—grew up in a “culture of childhood.” That is, t**hey grew up in a**
world where they had almost continuous social interactions with other children,
outside of adult control. This is where they learned how to initiate their own
activities, solve their own problems, create and follow rules, get along with
peers, and deal with bullies. In short, this is where they acquired the skills of
independence required, eventually, for adult life. 

 from about 1950 to about 1990
is that over this time we, as a society, were gradually destroying the culture of
childhood—by isolating kids at home, depriving them of freedom to roam and
play with other kids, and occupying them ever more with adult-controlled
activities.

kids connect now through video games. They would talk about games when they're in school during free time. Parents didn't understand it, some were against it, this brought excitement, and a feeling like they had their own world again.

mental health depends on the satisfaction of three basic
psychological needs: autonomy (the freedom to make one’s own
choices), competence (the sense of being good at a self-chosen task),
and relatedness (feeling connected to peers)

Computers for a generation between 1990 and 2005, and video games, helped improve mental health for kids and reduced suicide rates amongst teens. 

suicide rates were high between 2008 and 2019. Author believes this is because of the NCLB act in 2002 and the Common Core Standards Initiative in 2010.

 They brought a more rigid curriculum and high stakes testing to most
schools, and the tests began to be used not just to evaluate students but also to
evaluate teachers and whole school systems. Teachers no longer felt free to
adjust the methods and content of their teaching to accord with the interests
and needs of their students. They now felt compelled to teach in ways that
would, they hoped, increase scores on the mandated tests. 

more time drilling would produce higher test scores, recess and
subjects for which there was no mandated test, such as music and art, were
reduced or eliminated in many schools. to a survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ((2015), the
average time spent per day in recess (including any recess associated with the
lunch period) for U.S. elementary schools was just 26.9 minutes, and some
schools had no recess at all

hese Federal
interventions have regularly pointed to a reduction in creative and enjoyable
activities and increased focus on drill for high-stakes tests

There is very
little fun at all. These schools are under pressure to increase test scores, and they spend too much time with “skill and drill” test prep activities. In some of
these schools, the teachers’ salaries depend on the students’ test scores, pushing
some teachers to teach to the test and give lots of homework in hopes that test
scores will rise

Page 9 mentions lots of studies where kids say they're very stressed, and findings that they're the most stressed people in the country.

Page 10 mentions a lot of common beliefs from 10s, "You're doing great, why are you complaining? Crying for not having a 4.0, Spending more time doing hw at home than being at school."
rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts are much  higher for students at “high achievement schools” than for those at more typical schools.
The pressure on students derives not just from the school workload, but even more from the continuous evaluation of their performance and their perception
that their self-worth depends on how well they are doing in school. Many are convinced that a low grade would destroy their future.

Research conducted in recent years has shown that rates of mental breakdowns and suicides are much higher for students during months and weeks when
school is in session than during vacations from school.
hey found, overall, that the rate of such
visits in weeks when school was in session was 118% greater than in weeks
when school wasn’t in session. In other words, the rate of emergency psychiatric
visits during school weeks was more than double what it was during non-school
weeks.
This is consistent with the idea that school became more
stressful with each year from 2009 through 2012, but life outside of school did
not. It’s worth noting, in this graph, that in 2020 the rate of admissions dropped
sharply in March, April and May, unlike in other years. Those were months
when most schools were closed because of COVID, and several research studies
(which I reviewed here) revealed that mental health among students overall improved during those months.

Suicide rates were much
higher during school months than during vacation months. By comparing
suicide rates in different counties across the nation, they showed that the timing
of increased suicides corresponded closely with the timing of school openings.
In areas where schools opened in August, suicides began to increase in August. 

I’m often invited to speak at conferences of preschool and kindergarten teachers,
and many of the attendees express outrage and disgust at what they are required
to do to little children in their classrooms. Many of the best teachers have
resigned. Kids work too hard
All the research studies I’ve been able to find that examine long-term effects of
such early academic training have found that the effects are negative.
Experiments comparing students who were in academic preschools or
kindergartens with those who were in play-based preschools or kindergartens
have routinely shown that by third grade and beyond the former are socially,
emotionally, and even academically disadvantaged compared with the latter.

Mario Canales, [4/19/2024 12:08 PM]
Students who didn't attend a program designed to improve kids academics, did better than those who did.
The major finding was that children who had been in the program were, by 6th grade, performing more poorly by every measure than those who were not in the program. They performed more poorly on all academic achievement tests (in
reading, math, and science). Most significant, they were nearly twice as likely by 6th grade to have been diagnosed with a learning disorder compared to those who were not in the program. They also showed significantly more behavioral
problems, including rule violations and fighting in school, than those in the control group.
It seems quite possible to me that forcing little children to abide by the new preschool and kindergarten curricula is, for some children, traumatic child abuse, which makes them feel they are failures and burns them out about school and maybe other aspects of life before they have really started. I would not be surprised if children in the Tennessee preschool program, now teenagers, are more likely to feel suicidal than those who were kept at home in their economically impoverished families that year.
A tiny correlation between social media use and anxiety in
girls gets major press coverage with sometimes dramatic headlines, but a study showing that 83% of teens cite school pressure as a major source of distress, far more than any other cause, or that teens’ rates of mental breakdowns and suicides are about twice as high when school is in session than when it is not, gets essentially no coverage at all.

There seems to be, in our society, a taboo against admitting that school creates mental distress in the majority of students. School is something that we, the public, have imposed upon young people, so to blame schooling is to blame
ourselves, and that is hard. It is far easier to blame those profit-seeking social media and video game companies. If you attend to the popular press and avoid careful reading of the actual research literature, you are likely to believe that
new technology is the primary cause of young people’s distress.

The research aimed at understanding the relation of teens’ uses of digital technology to their mental health is of three main types: cross-sectional correlational studies, longitudinal correlational studies, and random assignment experiments. I will take each in turn. 15

In these studies, researchers collect data on the amount of time a sample of
adolescents spend with digital technology or some specific use of that
technology, such as social media, and, also data on some aspect of their mental
health, such as their level of anxiety or depression, and look for a correlation between the twol

The results showed no significant correlations over time in either direction. **Heavier**  
**smartphone use in a given week did not predict end-of-week mood states, and**  
**higher stress levels did not predict increases in smartphone use.** The researchers  
concluded, “**Our findings contribute to a growing scholarly consensus that time**  
**spent on smartphones tells us little about young people’s well-being.”**
Another recent example, over a longer period, is a study conducted by Silje  
Stensbekk and colleagues (2023) with 180 young people who were 10 to 16  
years old at the beginning of the study. **same results in recent study

**Random assignment experiments** are commonly regarded as ‘**the gold standard**”  
of **research aimed at showing causation,** but, as I will point out, they are  
**seriously flawed** when used in research **on effects of social media.**
Talks of an **experiment**, where if you spend **less time on your phone**, it should **improve your mental wellbeing**. Mixed findings. 
Mentions a study that claims to prove positive results in less phone usage.
This study, taken at face value, would seem to be good evidence that reducing  
social media use is good for mental health. However, I must note **two**  
**fundamental problems that apply to all experiments of this type**—problems that  
really negate the value of this approach.  
The first problem is the **placebo effect.** Same reason why it's hard to prove if anxiety or depression medication is effective. 

With drug studies you can hide from  
the subjects which ones are getting the drug and which are getting the placebo,  
but with **technology studies the subjects naturally know which group they are**  
**in.** **There is no way to show that an effect of reducing social media is not just a**  
**placebo effect.**

The **second problem** is what researchers call the **demand effect.** Subjects in  
research experiments are very good at guessing what the research hypothesis is  
and, consciously or unconsciously, are **motivated to prove the hypothesis**  
**correct**. (I’m sure there are some contrarians motivated to prove the hypothesis  
wrong, but much research has shown that the contrarians are in the minority.)  
In the experiments involving reduction in social media the hypothesis is pretty  
obvious. There is no good way of getting around the demand effect, and the  
effect may be especially strong in the typical experiments where the subjects are  
college students and the researchers are professors at that college.

**None of the random assignment experiments I found made any attempt to**  
**account for the placebo or demand effect, or even mentioned them.**

**Sharp increase in**  
**suicide rate from about 2008 to 2019 (the year before the COVID pandemic)**  
**resulted at least partly from increased school pressure brought on by No Child**  
**Left Behind and then Common Core**

**we have become ever more involved with their emotional experiences** as well as all  
their other experiences. In the process **we may have sensitized kids to negative**  
**emotional experiences in ways that exaggerate their negativity.**  
**Teasing** may be seen as “**bullying**.” **A flirtatious touch or comment** may be seen  
as “**sexual abuse**.” These may become disturbing, or even “traumatizing,” to the  
degree that we, or society in general, **teaches that they should be disturbing or**  
**traumatizing**. At the extreme, if one begins to s**ee every annoying question or**  
**comment as a “microaggression,**” one might begin to **believe** they are in a **sea of**  
**attack.** Where **once adults taught kids to recite sticks and stones** can break my  
bones but words can never hurt me, **adults today** are more likely to focus their  
**teaching** on ways that even relatively innocuous **words can hurt.**

Moreover, the repeated suggestion to **kids** that they **should talk to a counselor** or  
other authority about any problem they have **sends the implicit message that**
**they are unable to solve their own problems. We may in that way be teaching**  
**kids that they are fragile and helpless rather than resilient and competent.** When  
such disempowering messages are combined with restrictions on kids’  
independent play and activity—the traditional ways that kids have learned to  
solve problems on their own—the messages may be doubly effective in  
convincing kids that they are helpless. Helplessness, which is a primary  
component of anxiety, can lead to hopelessness, which is almost the definition  
of depression.
