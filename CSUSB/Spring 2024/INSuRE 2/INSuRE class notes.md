Concern: This CVE effects a container built, rather, than one already built

They want us to go forward with this CVE, because it's not patched

They like Ubunutu server




These TDs are lighter on us. As we build things and start going through what you're doing, document it.
You did 20 things, can't remember the five. Everything is a learning experience.

These five things didn't work, maybe it's because we didn't know enough, 

We learn, we can give tips. Get it into 

Docuemtn and get it into the share

Documenting slows us down, we'll sit there for three days, at the end magic happens. Production system or environment, you have to document, because a system operator will ask questions. 

### Know when our midterm and end proposal is
Start a powerpoint template

The midterm is telling people what we're going to do. Translate our proprosal into a midterm now. Here is what we are planning to do 
**Never tell them all your discoveries during the midterm. Only what you're going to do and waht you've started**
- If you tell them your findings you won't have much to say for the final


### 2-16-24

Talk about proposal, very little about progress
Power point with our notes
writing up the proposal, 
create a skeleton, all we do is fill in our notes
