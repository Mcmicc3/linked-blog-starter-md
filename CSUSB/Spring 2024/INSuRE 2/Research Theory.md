 
## How to make a proposal


Go from experimental research to an applied researched method
- If we have a tool, how do benchmark the tool, and grade it by manipulating certain variables

Not all researchers know exactly what they're doing

When we took a science class
- Write a purpose
- Hypothesis

What's the purpose?
- What's the qyestion we're trying to answer

What's the outcome?
- Understanding of tools
- Behavior of something

Hypothesis?
- If we don't know it, how would we know what should happen?
- This is where a literature review comes in, reserach

Find good qualoity studies, ;earn what's been done before, and how we can predict a behavior

Medicine, and psychology is the best for methodology
Medicine as an analog for research
- We can never say 100% that  medicine can work
- Different variables, different genes, different allergies,

There's cloned lab rats, they inject them with the medicine.

Cured cancer in rats, long road from there to people
- Rats are cloned, no genetic vairables
- People are different, people from all around the world
- Environmental variables

During Covid, people were throwing data of things that don't work
- They're pulling apart the thousands of vairables of what makes a human being, and saying these things don't work
- Unethical to clone people

#### Same goes here
Basis of theory, previous studies, help us reduce or control variables for us.

Medicine
- Can't clone people
- But you can take a population, test something, and ask about their background to categorize them
- What studies have been done to these populizations??
- Build a body of accepted principles. Accept things as fact

Perfect? No, but something that's been done
- Generally accepted principle
- Take a lot of stuff, do a literature review
- Should make some type of hypothesis

Statistics comes in.

What is our predicted outcome? 
- Based on prior research our predictive outcome is this

Where does our research exist?
- Expected outcome, is a hypothesis
- You have to have a reason behind it
- *I think this will happen because of the past 6 experiments.*

Something that has never been before is less reliable
- *Kiss of death*

Everyday we exist because of research
- Ex: We eat a pickle, millions of people eat pickles, there's research on pickles
- FDA has set standards for how pickles should be packaged, their safe ingrediants, how long it can sit on a shelf.
- The pickle in our burger has gone through decades of research

With AI, IBMs Deepblue project, allows us to review past research

Past research was done in the past by the Nazis
- Horrible experiments
- They're looking at those experiments and testing to see if they're wrong

Trylonal was the go to pain killer, because asprin affected certain people a certain way. Trylaon was deemed safe. Someone looked into it with AI, and found that people who took it routinely found liver damage. 
- They were looking at experiments from the 60s
- IBPROfim was found to cause blindness
- Power of variables, reserach

Proposal
- Purpose
- Objective
- Hypothesis - well reasoned

The reason we believe this hypothesis is because we've done the research and found that another experiement ofund something a certain way

Sounds simple, but it won't be

ChatGPT has been found to make up references

Find a good study, and on the bottom dig through their references.

Assigned reserach librarian, contact them

We don't need an exhaustive literally review, but we should know the literature to builf the hypothesis.

Build on prior reserach.

Abstract searches, in this study we looked at this problem, apploed this method and there were the outcomes.
Some were better than others.

What kind of study am I really doing?
- 20 different ways we can do this
- In chapter 4, it describes different research methods. Here is rease
Observational
- Don't manipulate varubales
- But observe things under a certain condiiton
How do we set this up
- You have to say what kind of research are we really doing here?

Ask what type of reserach are we doing>

Exploratory? Observationaa??


Tony thinks we should be around chapter 11 or 12 

Exploratory study
- Data collection, anayliusis, intereptuation 
- Take a look at 12 different products and see how they work in a different ways
- Have 12 differnet people use it, ask which they find easier.
- Observing behaviors.

The chaoter gets us to tak ea look at how we collect data
- Helps define why one method is better than other

Independent vs dependent variable
- Indepedent can behave on it's on, turns to 1 and 0, not affected on the rest
- Dependednt vairable is dependent on other vairbales

Tyler and a can of coke are independant vairables
The action of drinking a can of coke, 
- Say we're measuring the affect it has on his body, it becomes dependent
- Measure his teeth, his bone density, whatever

How do we categorixze these variables and which ones can we control?

Say we drink one can very fast, and another very slow
- Can we maniuplate time?
- It's independant, because we can't change time
- The only dependeant variables is understanding how it affects

Observational reserach is the easiest, because we find the two different types of vairbales, and try to understand how they react to each other
- Introduce a condition that would illicit a reaction

Some of hte most famous studies are banned
- Famous because they were good, but caused terrible 

The experiment where you shock someone if they get an answer wrong,
- The person leading was wearing a lab coat vs someone in an authority uniform. 
- Classic example of observational research
- Another one where the teachers with blue eye, brown eyes, 

This chapter has a lot of terminology that we could use
- Best pracites for gathering data
- What type of studying are we doing
- **Use these terms in the proposals**
- Understand if it's an applied experiment, and observation, exploratory

Recommends we look at chapter 11 or 12. 

The earlier goes into defining terminology. The later chapters assumes we already know them
- If there's a theory how to we build from it and design the experiment we want to do. 
- How do we benchmark success?
- Look for existing benchmarks
- Here's what success looks like, and failure looks like
- In the world of cyber, nothing is ever secure
- Just like how not one medicine is 100% a success

Tony - *You can always get into something, always*

That won't be a hypothesis. You need conditions in a higher order that will show we're more secure, or less of something, depending on the design of our experiment.

10 years, ago, they used to have the class read 100 reserach papers and classify them
- Not useful
- PHd, they do stuff like that.

Instead, he's giving us this book. Start thinking, systematically what it is that we're doing. Removing benchmark. This might be how our proposal will go

Very linear, or will we be observing behavior

Sample vairables that we can maniupalate

#### Chapter 12
Goes over how we would handle an observational study
How to design an applied study, Goes a broad way of discussing how we're going to make something happen. If we're doing product, here are data
- Stress testing
- Perfgoramance testing
- Load testing

20 servers in a lab product, we're going to run the tool and see what happens. 
Vs a set of conditions, 12 attacks from different malware and see what happens. 

Recommends that we look at prior proposal.

Chapter 4 so we understand terminology, then look at chapter 11 and 12
Same time look at basic resrach in that 

This is how we do reserach, and how we make decisions. Once we understand it, it unlocks the keys to the kingdom. You'll be asking too many questions


### Logistics
We now need to contact our tech dirtecors

The world of cyber is so wide, we're going to get lost.

We need to set meetings with them, professional communication.
- They're not dude, they're taking time
- See what kind of parameters they have in mind
- Ask if they're certain studies they'd like us to look at. 

Don't just fly into this. 

First, read these chapters, then contact them because they know the subject matter. 

Always a good idea to cc Coulson. He always has Fridays open.

We can even invite them to Slack if we want. 
- Professional meeting with actual questions designed.
- You never know if they'll love you so much that they'll offer you a job or a letter of recommendation.

What's next in insure
- Look at project deadlines for proposlas. 
- Best time to ask Coulson to look over it? Soon as possible.
- As the project moves forward, he'll be a little harsher. 
They'll have a direction, more experience. They'll say we've done that.
Haver a conversation, what we feel is natural
- The only good disertation, is a done one
- Do somethings that's acheivable
- Even if we fail in our experiment, it still provides value?

On our side, we might be observing more, find a mehtod tha

- Ask, what are your expectations, because we've been thinking of this or that.
