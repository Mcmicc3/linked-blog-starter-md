Job descriptions are not used exclusively for the hiring process; they should be maintained throught the life of the organization. Only through detailed job descriptions can a comparison be made between what a person should be responsiblef or and what they actually are responsible for.

Well-designed onboarding can result in higher levels of job satisfaction, higher levels of productivity, faster integration with existing workers, a rise in organizational loyalty, stress reduction, and a decreased occurrence of resignation. 

*Identity and access management (IAM)* provides a computer/network user account for a new employee. It assigns necessary privileges and access. 

True application of *The Principle of Least Privilege* requires low-level granular control over all resources and functions. 

A *Mandatory vacation* is when an employee has to take a week or two week vacation, and while they're on vacation, another employee is doing an audit and working their position, but using the same credentials as the employee on vacation, to easily check for fraud or abuse of privileges. It's hard to cover abuse when someone else is using your account. 

When several people work together to perpretrate a crime, it's called *collusion*. Separation of duties, restricted job responsibilities, mandatory vacations, job rotation, and cross-training reduces the likelihood that a coworker will be willing to collaborate on an illegal or abusive scheme because of the higher risk of detection. 

*User behavior analytics (UBA)* and *user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)* are the concepts of analyzing the behavior of users, subkjects, visistors, customers, and so forth for some specific goal or purpose. 

Offboarding is the removal of an employees identity from the IAM system. Offbaording can also be an element used when *employee transfers* intoa  new job position. It is common to disable accounts of prior employees in order to retain the idetnity for auditing purposes for a few months. After the alloted time, if no incidents are discovered in regard to the ex-employee's account, then it can be deleted from the IAM completely. If it's deleted prematurely, any logged events that are of a securritty concnern no longer point to an actual account and thus can make tracking down furhter evidence of violations more complicated.
