# Core concepts of Zero Trust, and resources

Here's a breakdown of important subjects in zero trust to focus on for your project, along with resources to learn more:

**Core Concepts:**

- **Never Trust, Always Verify:** This principle underpins zero trust. Every user and device must be continuously authenticated and authorized before granting access to resources.

- **Least Privilege Access:** Users are granted only the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks. This minimizes damage if an attacker gains access to a user account.

- **Microsegmentation:** Networks are divided into smaller segments with restricted access between them. This limits an attacker's ability to move laterally within the network if they gain a foothold.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is critical in a Zero Trust model. It requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, adding an additional layer of security beyond just a username and password.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Properly managing identities and their access levels plays a crucial role. This includes not only users but also devices and applications, ensuring they are authenticated and authorized appropriately.
- **Endpoint Security:** In a Zero Trust architecture, securing endpoints is crucial since devices are considered untrusted by default. This involves regular monitoring and validation of device security posture before granting access.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Validation:** Zero Trust requires continuous analysis of network traffic and user behavior to identify and respond to threats in real-time. This ongoing evaluation helps to detect and mitigate potential security breaches more effectively.
- **Encrypt Data, Both at Rest and in Transit:** Ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted helps protect it from interception and unauthorized access, further supporting the Zero Trust principle of assuming that threats could exist anywhere.
- **Explicit Verification:** Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before being granted, based on all available data points, including user identity, device, location, and other variables that could affect security posture.

**Benefits of Zero Trust:**

- **Improved Security Posture:** Zero trust helps prevent breaches and data leaks by minimizing the attack surface and reducing the impact of successful attacks.
- **Enhanced User Productivity:** Secure access from anywhere, on any device, allows for a more flexible and productive workforce.
- **Cloud Adoption:** Zero trust is well-suited for securing cloud-based resources and hybrid environments.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Zero Trust Maturity Model:** This model by CISA provides a roadmap for organizations to assess their current security posture and develop a plan for implementing zero trust. [https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model)
- **Technologies for Zero Trust:** Multi-factor authentication, identity and access management, data encryption, and endpoint security are all crucial components of a zero trust architecture.
