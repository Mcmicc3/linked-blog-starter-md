List of employees?

When did the strange emails start?

Someone claims 4:44 or 4:39, July 19th? claims it all happened one day

Was the first suspicious email the bad thing that happened, or did anything else happen leading up to that day?

Something wrong with the website??? 20th, day after,
bob was getting emails from himself?

# Questions

Who is Alex?

Why did Jean decide to comply with Alex? Incompetence?

Can multiple people register the same outlook email account to different user accounts? is it possible that the emails sent to alison@m57.biz are also being forwarded to both users?

How did Bob know his PII was on the internet so fast? Why did he decided to go directly to the CFO? 

Jean asks Alison what was this thing about Katie Holmse's hands?
