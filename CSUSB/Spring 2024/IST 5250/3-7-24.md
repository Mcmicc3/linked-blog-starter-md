List of employees?

When did the strange emails start?

Someone claims 4:44 or 4:39, July 19th? claims it all happened one day

Was the first suspicious email the bad thing that happened, or did anything else happen leading up to that day?

Something wrong with the website??? 20th, day after,
bob was getting emails from himself?
