Digital Evidence - Anything of probative value
- Anything that tends to prove, or disprove support or not support, the theory of a case. 

KFF - Known File Filter
- Run windows file through this
- Makes the needle in the haystack smaller
- Checks MD5 hash, and if they match Microsoft OS
- Checks for anything different

An installation of Chrome may not have anything different or special between different installations, but the **cookies** will

We see damning evidence
- Same log in for a suspect
- But we can't prove it was that individual who searched it
- *Not the smoking gun*


- Remote log ins?
- Network connections?
