# FTK Imager
Software used to make images of evidence. THe images when used correctly, will make a bit for bit copy of evidence. Always have a device handy when you do it. You will need a **Write blocker**. 
- Technically You can do logical structure, or simple files

##### Write blocker
Connects to the drive that you're connecting to
- Windows is chatty, as you're copying, windows is writing back to the drive
- When you connect to the drive, windows is chatty recording in the registry where you connected
- **STUFF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE COPYING A DRIVE**

### What a digital forensics expert does on site of a crime scene
You take pictures of a crime scene so they can't make a claim that it was mishandled.
- Sushi thumb drive

Identify what's evidence

Make sure that whatever state the drive was in at the time (time stamped), when you start to work on that drive, there should be** zero or as little bits written by you**
- If the software you're using is leaving any remnants, you need to know the software so you can say exactly where it makes edits on a machine (registry)

Make a bit for bit copy. As soon as this is done, run an MD5 and confirm an exact match.

Bag it. The bag cannot be broken open. Your name has to be on it, and you have to write who you're handing it to. 
- Chain of evidence

## FTK imager
Three options for source of evidence
- Physical 
	- Used often in the real world.
- Logical 
	- Copy of the files and folders, but not a bit for bit copy
- Image
	- Done in class
- Contents of a folder
	- Sounds like logical....

We're working with mantooth001 (file type 001)

Anything with a red X on the icon, is a deleted file or folder, **but not to us**. 

There's a capture memory\y button that will capture the memory that you're on
- If you image his drive, and look at it from this computer, when you run capture memory, **you're looking at your own memory**
- Run it when you're on the suspect computer

#### Mounting images
If you mount it, it will become a drive on your pc. 
- Mounts are read only

Export drive image, E01, 
- E01 and AFF will compress it and give you header information
- The other two options....didn't sound important

Save everything to the D drive

You can right click image tree, and it will let you look at a checksum

When we compress it and save it to the PC, it changes the size of the file. 

When you create an N case file
If you run an md5 on the compressed version of the file, 
the header of the file, 

md5 doesn't check the header when it makes a hash. The file is compressed, but the file in the md5 hash is still correct. It's not the file, it's the file inside it.
