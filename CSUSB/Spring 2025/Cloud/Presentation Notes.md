Strategies, Short-term investment and long term benefit, Quantifying benefits beyond costs, talk about tools

# Slide 1

1. **Rehost**
We take everything and move it into a IaaS provider like AWS EC2 or Azure VMS
- Speed and Simplicity
- Catch: If you don't right size, meaning you don't adjust the capacity to fit cloud usage patters, you'll still pay up to 70-80% of your old on-prem cost. You need to optimize

1. **Replatform**
Make light changes when moving stuff to the cloud (Managed database, or containerized workload). You're optimizing how code runs
- There will be a bump in migration costs, but a bigger payoff over time in staff efficiency. 

1. **Refactor**
Rewriting the application, often into microservices or serverless achitectures. 
- Most expensive and time consuming up front, 
- Potential for bringing the greatest return on investment by building natively for the cloud. This gives the benefits of scalability, agility, and faster delivery of features. 
- **Meant for those looking to become cloud native**

1. **Repurchase**
Ditching in house solutions for SaaS
- Eliminates infrasturcutre and licensing headaches
- Costs shift from capital expenditures to operating expenses, since SaaS typically operates as a subscription
- **Warning**: Has the potential for vendor lock in. Organizations should reflect on their long-term flexibility and data portability for this solution

1. **Retain or Retire**
You perform inventory and decide which workloads should stay on-premise, maybe because they have some compliance or latency needs, and if there's anything else that doesn't need to be moved to the cloud, consider retiring them. 
- This strategy helps avoid migrating apps with negative ROI
- Save money, most organizations find that 5-15% of their applications do not, or no longer delivery on their intended value.

1. **People**
You need people with cloud fluency. That means time for them to understand what apps and data a business is working with. They need time to train on the cloud platforms, and sometimes it's worth considering hiring professional serverice partners to guide or accelerate the process
- After migration, the operations team will get smaller because the cloud handles most of the infrastructure grunt work, and then implement FinOps, to help teams optimize and forecast cloud spending in real-time

1. **Infrastructure**
At the beginning you'll be paying for both on-prem and cloud systems at once. This is sometimes called dual-run, or shadow IT. You might also pay for data egress charges, which is when charges are being placed for moving large amounts of data to the cloud.
- If you plan this carefully and can afford it, the model then transforms into a pay as you go environment, where you only pay for what you use. 
- And if you take the time to right-size, you save even more money, 

1. **Licensing**
You'll need to assess compatability and compliance with the licenses you already have at hand. Not only that, but jumping from a self hosted data base server to a fuller managed SaaS solution, may lead to a bump in cost.
- In the long term, the flexibility of this solution will help save money. 

1. **Tools & Governance**
When migrating, expect to invest in new tools, SUCH AS 
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployments.
    
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for repeatable environments.
    
- **Observability** stacks like logging, metrics, and tracing to monitor what’s going on.

These new costs may feel like a burdon, but in the long run, after everything is stabilized, these tools **lower Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** and **increase deployment frequency**, meaning issues can be fixed faster, and ship improvements more often.

5. **Facilities / energy**
There's no immediate savings in the short term, but in the long term after fully migrating, the facilities overhead disapears. Lowering HVAC, server maintenance, and power costs.


# Slide 3
**Scalability:**
you pay only for what you use. Forecast that using **autoscaling pricing curves**, and you’ll often find you can **avoid 20–50% of infrastructure costs** during peak seasons. That’s huge.

**Time-to-market:**
Because cloud migration often goes hand in hand with DevOps practices: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and self-service platforms. To measure the impact here, look at:

- Deploys per week — how often you ship code.
    
- MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) — how fast you recover from incidents.

**Operational Resilience**
This is about uptime — not just planned, but unplanned outages.

Here’s how you model it: compare your Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and disaster recovery metrics — specifically:

- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) — how quickly can you come back online?
    
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) — how much data can you afford to lose?

**Security Posture

Security is one of the most immediate wins if done right.

Legacy systems often harbor unpatched vulnerabilities — known as CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). When you migrate to managed PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) offerings and turn on auto-patching, many of those legacy issues disappear by default.

**Sustainability**
Cloud isn’t just smarter — it’s also greener.

To model this benefit, you can use carbon calculators provided by cloud vendors:

- AWS CCF (Customer Carbon Footprint tool)
    
- Azure ECIF (Emissions Impact Dashboard)
    

Compare that to your data center’s PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) — which measures how efficiently you use energy.


# Slide 4
**AWS Migration Evaluator**
These tools give you an **agentless inventory** — meaning they can scan your environment without needing to install anything on your servers — and then generate a **3-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** forecast. What’s powerful here is that it includes **CPU utilization-based rightsizing** — so instead of assuming your current server size is optimal, it adjusts for what you _actually use_.

**Azure Migrate Business Care**
This tool compares your current on-prem costs to Azure’s offerings. It includes **year-over-year (YOY) cash flow projections**, and even surfaces a list of **“quick wins”** — workloads that are low-effort and high-reward to migrate first.

**Google Migration Center TCO Report**
Google’s tool lets you compare **lift-and-shift** scenarios with **modernized architectures**, while also automatically applying **sustained-use discounts** — which reward workloads that run consistently over time.

### **Flexera One / Apptio Cloudability**

These are **FinOps platforms** — tools that help you manage cloud spending across multiple providers. They provide **anomaly detection**, visibility into **unit economics**, and track **zombie resources** — which are unused or forgotten assets still racking up costs post-migration.

### **CAST Highlight / Cloudamize**

These platforms dive into your **application code** to evaluate how cloud-ready it is. They score your workloads using the **6R model** (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, etc.) and identify potential **code-level blockers** that could slow down or complicate migration.


### **Financial Models (NPV, IRR, Payback Period)**

Beyond cloud-native tools, your finance team likely has its own models for measuring ROI — things like **Net Present Value (NPV)**, **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**, and **payback period**.


**In conclusion**, navigating cloud migration isn’t just about moving servers — it’s about transforming how your organization operates, innovates, and delivers value. We’ve explored the practical strategies for migrating systems, the cost shifts you’ll face in both the short and long term, the measurable benefits you can expect, and the tools that bring all of this into focus.

But the key message is this: **successful cloud transformation is both a technical and a financial journey**. It requires clear-eyed planning, continuous optimization, and the ability to communicate value in terms both IT leaders and business executives understand.

If you can bring together the right approach, the right cost models, and the right forecasting tools, you’re not just migrating — you’re positioning your organization for resilience, agility, and long-term growth.

Thank you.
