VMware Hypervisor

            When it comes to installing a guest distro, on a type two hypervisor, there’s more than one solution in which software to choose from. If I were to recommend which hypervisor to explore and get accommodated with, I would suggest using VMware. Specifically VMware Pro Workstation, as it’s a free software that is useful for both work and home use. The reason there is an argument to be made that VMware is the better choice for a hypervisor, is that it’s the industry standard in virtualization software, and is the solution you’ll often come across in business environments. As opposed to Virtualbox, another hypervisor solution that is still effective, but is more appropriate for home use. It doesn’t compare to VMware, because VMware offers a vast list of choices for hypervisors that are useful for many different business needs which could include, support for network infrastructure, support as a virtualization server that can connect to type 1 hypervisors, and many other use cases. There are many other types of services offered by VMware, but workstation pro is great for teaching yourself and getting used to configuring and managing an industry standard hypervisor.
