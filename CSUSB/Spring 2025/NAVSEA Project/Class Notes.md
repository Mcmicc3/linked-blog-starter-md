Some devices have two network cards. One of them used to be for a BAT network??? disable that network card. 

WAN port of the WAN router, needs to be set to DHCP. HOWEVER, we don't set an IP to the network card that connects to the internet. The port that needs internet access, needs to be set to DHCP

In CoyoteGPT, if you type `#`, one of the options should say dogpark. It's loaded with manuals for softwares that will be used in dogpark

Return routes,
are the routes going up or down?
