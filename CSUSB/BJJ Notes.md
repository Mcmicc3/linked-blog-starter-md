Whats the process for next year 
- For graduate students

First we introduced ourselves and talk about how club is going
- I mentioned that we have new members joining us, and we have a good number of members who regularly visit
- I mentioned that we're working on CSUSB rashguards, and an issue we had with trying to compete with other schools, but we're trying to get that working

Advice: delegate, make sure we communicate, and make sure we do things safe.

Wants our input on reserved facilities: what goals do we have? 

Two things to acoomplish: working with amber and her group to make sure that we recharter. 
- Dont come into fall worrying about how to recharter
Developing our advisory board
- Two positions, cheer, and vice cheer
- Work and develop these programs to the fullest

We're going to do a great job, but when we leave, **will the club survive?**'


What do we need to 

We're getting a new roster?

Trent: there is money to help sports clubs, decisions they make to better our club, **But**, we shouldn't be comfortable thinking the school is our bank. 

Make sure we have people signing in, those numbers help. When they request more money, they have something to show how many people are participating. 

# Important

Post our events on coyote connection.

34 club practices, but it shows that only one person showed up 
- Check in process on my coyote. Put in ID numbers
- First practice, it was 16, but after that it was **zero**

Maybe a QR code for people to scan that can upload to mycoyote. 
Several ways to do check in.

QR code on mycoyote. it tracks attendance on mycoyote. 
- Add attendence
- Type in ID numbers
These numbers are also helpful to trent, someone else can to
- They can export the IDs

# Important

Kaelyn Blackwell , has all the check ins on a binder, they put it all on a spreadsheet. 
- **I'm sure this is what we're doing**
Can't ,manipulate coyote connect to get the numbers. 

# Important
We can use coyote connect to upload event meetings


### Waivers
Let amber know when we are collecting new waivers

### Fundraising and dues
Powerlifting club did a fundraiser using panda express.
We can partner with other restaurants on campus. Also outside businesses.

CAP funding is a reimbursment funding.
T-Shirts have a certain number. Sometimes they need to pay out of pocket and will get reimbursed. 
Someone named Autumn is helpful with funding. She'll help with all the legal stuff. 


Trent: If we're doing activites outside of campys, **we need to fill out the travel itinerary**. It is for our protection. 

EMS is reserving our space if we're not doing it through rec well. Make sure we reserve with recwell, 

Keep Trent in the loop when we reserve rooms outside of our regular practice events
- Wrestling is doing a movie night in another room.

Let Kaelyn know when we do fundraisers, they get promoted. If we post something on our own, amber and them will repost it

# Chartering workshop
Every club is required to do it. They need to know who next years club presidents are. 
- If we don't respond to emails, they will shutdown our practices until we get business handled. 


# Practices during summer
Charter ends in June, so they would need to redo it in July.

Canvas course? that is on us to complete when we can.
Our officers need to make it to our in person meetings. CAB will give funding training? The faster we do it, the faster we get it recharterd.
They don't just one person doing those workshops, if you're a senior, make sure a junior or a sophmore goes too.
Charter needs to be filled out by someone who isn't a senior? President, Vice President, treasurer are required to attend meetings.

Monthyl meeting.

# Woops
Trent: Their office is unaware, those individuals **should not be using the CSUSB name**, and they're not covered by the school. They are particiapting on their own. We need to make sure w
- There's paperwork that needs to be done.
- Incase someone gets injured, they won't be covered.
- They said I would have to talk to someone (fuck), for things that are outside of the school club. 

	If we have events after June, we need to be rechartered first, or we won't be covered

Talk to Amber if we want our club promoted for events (such as Cosmic Coyote). 

Have a bigger showing at late night. This will include PDC?

If we have ideas and suggestions

For outside events, talk to Trent.
