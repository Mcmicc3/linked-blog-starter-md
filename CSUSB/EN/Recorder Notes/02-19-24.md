Continuing where we left off on Article 5 section 3.3

# Article 5
### Continuing from A.5 S.3.3
Anthony suggests that if too many people have good grades, we can lose money
- Steve suggests lowering the amount from 50% off to 25%
- Or writing a caveat related to a fundraiser

### A.5 S4
We are removing 3.3 and combining it with 4.4. They're basically the same.
- Increasing the GPA to 3.5 and increasing the amount to 25%

removing 4.6 - 

### A.5 S.5.1
Treasurer has the ability to nullify a late fee


### A.5 S.2.0
Section 2.1: Cumulative 2.5, term 2.2

Section 2.8: Lowering it from 2.0 to 1.7

Sections 3.1 & 3.2, keeping it the same


# Article 7

We want to make two different types of suspension, academic and disciplinary suspension.

People on academic suspension should focus on grades
- Thinks they should still be able to wear letters
- Just can't do the fun stuff
- Can still attend meetings

Disciplinary suspension
- More harsh, no letters, can't have a voice, shouldn't be greeted by candidates

Tabling 1.6, we're going to change it so that the fee of being under disciplinary suspension will be the cost of what HQ would charge us (conclave fee, insurance)
- 150$ for both suspensions, is charged per semester

# Article 8 

Removing 2.3 so that people can't just go into candidate meetings 

Editing 2.2 so that there is a Candidate Team, and the Marshal can invite people in.
- That way people can make sure the marshal is doing his job
- EC has the right to come in, as long as they're dressed formally.

Leaving 3.3 alone, it's up to the brother how many days a week they want to be greeted

Updating 4.1, basically so it's not just monday, but whatever meeting day is

Keeping 6.1 and 6.2 the same

Editing 10.2 so that candidates are not allowed to drink
Adding 10.3, candidates are responsible for their own actions

Editing 11.1, moving from 10 to 12 weeks. Marshall has the choice to pick weeks off


# Article 10

Elections off academic year, or calendar year?
- Changing it to an academic year, not calendar

# Article 8 section 14


Coming up with a rule where if this is your last semester, you have last picks

Tabling up the idea for big brother and little brother situation
