Someone from the glen named Key Jacobs emailed Doug and said they host cool stuff. The glen offered to sponsor our lunch. Possible idea for a rush event.
- Possible idea for a rush event.

Speedy messaged us saying that he contacted somebody from the Brea Improv group, and they offered to help setup a fundraiser for us if we can help sell more tickets for those events.

# Summer plans
We will host virtual meetings on teams, they will be informal, and we will discuss recruitment plans for the fall.
