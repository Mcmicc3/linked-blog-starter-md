# Potato Wedges

- **Yukon Gold Potatoes:** Baby golden potatoes if you can find them. Regular Yukon golds will work too.
- **Olive Oil:** Just enough to coat the potatoes for seasoning to stick
- **Italian Seasoning:**  A complete full of flavor herb blend
- **Garlic**: Freshly minced
- **Salt and Pepper:** To taste
- **Parmesan Cheese:** Use finely shredded cheese for the best texture.
- **Chopped Parsley:** This is optional and for garnish.

# Chicken Legs
- **Chicken Legs:** You will want the skin on these. It creates that crispy outside shell that everyone loves.
- **Paprika:** Adds flavor and color to the drumsticks.
- **Italian Seasoning:** A perfect blend of seasoning to go right on top.
- **Brown Sugar:** Adds a little bit of caramelization and sweetness to each leg.
- **Salt and Pepper:** Add to taste!
- **Olive Oil:** This helps the seasoning stick to the chicken and gives it a nice crisp skin once air fried.
