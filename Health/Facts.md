# Intermittent Fasting
Helps Reduce Insulin

## 3 Tips for intermittent fasting
1. Get enough sea salt
	1. If you don't you get keto fatigued and feel tired
2. Don't come in with a preset fasting schedule
	1. Basically, if you aren't hungry, don't eat
	2. Let appetite dictate how long we fast for
3. Force body to only burn belly fat by reducing by close to zero
	1. Do this with mostly red meat and veggies

# Sugar
## Processed Sugar
Heavily processed to the point that nutrients, B Vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, Phytonutrients, Antioxidents are removed
- Glucose (Dextrose)
- Corn Syrup
- Glucose Syrup
- High Fructose Corn Syrup
- Agave Syrup
- White/Brown Sugar   (half glucose, half fructose)
- Rice Syrup
Suck nutrients out of your tissues
## Whole sugar
In order to convert sugar into energy, **It needs nutrients**.
If there's Fiber (like in fruit), it will **lower the blood sugar spike** that happens.
Phytonutrients (Antioxidants) help protect against the damage sugar puts on your cells
- Raw Honey
- Maple Syrup
- Turbinado
- Molasses
- Coconut Sugar
###### Less processed 
- Palm Sugar
- Date Sugar

## Fructose vs Glucose
Fructose is only metabolized by the liver
Glucose can be metabolized by the entire body
- This is why too much high fructose corn syrup leads to a fatty liver, Type 2 diabetes, High blood pressure, and obesity
- Agave Syrup is 80% Fructose

#### Facts
Even though natural sugars have fructose, they come with nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants that prevent damage

Pair sugars with proteins or fats so your blood glucose levels won't spoke as quickly.

# 7 Foods to avoid

## Liquid drinks

## Pasteurized cheese product
Names include: Processed cheese, cheese food, or pasteurized cheese product.

## Protein bars (Scam)

## Seed Oil Mayonnaise
Avoid soy oil
	- **Seed oil** that is *highly processed.* 
	- Highly inflammatory
	- 95% of soy oil is GMO
	- A lot of people are allergic to it
Alternative: Primal kitchen brand, or chosen
- Made with avocado oil

## Sweetened Flavored Yogurt
More sugar in yogurt than there is in ice cream
A lot of kids are sensitive to red dye 40
You think you're getting a probiotic, but you're really getting a pathogen

Get plain whole fat, grassfed yogurt from A2 protein cows
- Bulgarian yogurt
- Whole fat keefer
- Grassfed sheep or goat

## Soy Protein
Cheap protein that gives gastinal problems

## Modified Starches
Not food
It's a cheap filler that acts like sugar, and spikes it in your blood
- Average consumer eats 30 lbs of this starch a year
- 50 different names to camouflage
	- Maltodextrin, modified food starches
- Doritos is 53% modified starch
**Causes Insulin resistance**

Natural starches: Butternut squash, beets, plantains
- Purple, or red potatoes

# Before, During, and After a workout
[Dr. Eric Berg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=181s)
## Four variables to exercise

1. The duration (How long you excersie for)
2. The intensity
3. The recovery
4. The frequency (How often you workout a week)

## Recovery
The problem with not giving yourself a 2 - 3 minute rest between sets, is that you don't give your body a chance to **replenish ATP**
- You won't be able to train at your maximum output
- He suggests 4 to 5 minutes for high intensity sets

The benefits of high intensity exercises occurs 1 - 2 days after, when you're sleeping
- Body adapts to the stress

sympathetic nervous system...
- Accelerating, sprinting
Parasympathetic Nervous system... [5:46]
- Pumping the breaks
- You can train this system 

### Contrast Therapy
- Cold shower, then a hot shower
- Ice bath, then a sauna

Supposed to help recovery and repair to help **decrease inflammation and time needed to repair**

### Eccentric motion 
elongate muscle..pushup, pullup
- Focus on the motion, you'll get more benefits
- Focus on the negative emotion, elongating of the motion, bigger faster muscles and delayed soreness

## Carbohydrates
If you take a protein bar, or a liquid drink that contains sugar, you're shutting down ketosis, fat burning, and **Autophagy**, which is the recycling of old damaged proteins. Anti aging effect
- get to a point where you can exercise in a fasting state

bring carbs up to 50 grams [12:19]
- 3 cups of berries per day
- 75 grams if you're younger

Electrolyte powder [13:13]
- Potassium
- Magnesium
- Calcium
- Chloride
All are important for the contraction of muscles. You'll also be more hydrated.

## What to eat after the workout
Best protein for muscle growth after a exercise is red meat [13:53].
Hambuger, steak, lamb

Why is it important? More concentrates of amino acids than chicken, than plant based proteins. **Red meat is what you're trying to build.** 
- Cartatine - pushes fat into the mitochondria
- Creatine - gives muscles fuel
- Carnesine  - anti acid, 
**Co-factors:** Red meat has iron, B vitamins
- Required for letting the amino acids to work

Consuming Whey protein alone doesn't give you the co-factor

Inside muscles, what generates energy is the mitochondria. 
- kreb cycle
- Turns food into the building blocks to make body tissue
You need certain micronutrients for this to work. You need:
- Iron
- B1
- B2
- B3
- B6
- B5
- Manganese
- Coensyme Q10
- Magnesium

Red meat has all of this. 
........Chicken has too many omega-6 fatty acids
- Stop thinking of chicken as a clean protein
- Make sure the chicken has the skin on it [19:20]
	- Same with fish

High quality cheese is loaded with protein.
- Find raw European cheese

Don't get the lean red meat. You need the fat. Grassfed is the best, but don't get the leanest version. 


## Recovery in-between workouts
Don't workout if you're sore.
Focus on sleep

Athletes usually are low on copper, and that sometimes messes with their sleep. 


# Red Meat, the single best food for healing and repair
# Lowering Cholesterol
# Carbs
Carbohydrates are macronutrients that provide your body with energy in the form of calories. When digested, carbs turn into sugar, which gives your body glucose, an important source of energy. Foods that can contain carbohydrates include:

Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, and milk. 

# Natural Starches

# Keto
Has the potential to raise LDL cholesterol

But, burning foot causes you to lower your cholesterol
Advance lipid test? checks LDL
